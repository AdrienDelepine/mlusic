Sittin', waitin' for me slippin', yeah, I'll see you in hell
Tell the cougar get up off me, no, my soul ain't for sale
All the evils in the world, they keepin' on me for real
I really hope the Lord heard me, we all live in sin

Now this the theme song, this the theme song
The put the beams on, get your, get your dream on
But you don't hear me though, drama: we let it go
Watch the guitars roll, but let your friends know

Oh, oh, oh

I know, I know, I know, I know, know
I, I know it, I know it

The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
Today, I seriously thought about killing you
I contemplated, premeditated murder
And I think about killing myself
And I love myself way more than I love you, so…
Today, I thought about killing you, premeditated murder
You'd only care enough to kill somebody you love
The most beautiful thoughts are always inside the darkest
(Mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm)
Just say it out loud to see how it feels
People say ""don't say this, don't say that""
Just say it out loud, just to see how it feels
Weigh all the options, nothing's off the table
Today, I thought about killing you, premeditated murder
I think about killing myself
And I, I love myself way more than I love you
The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
(Mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhm—mhmm)
I think this is the part where I'm supposed to say somethin' good to compensate it so it doesn't come off bad
But sometimes I think really bad things
Really, really, really bad things
And I love myself way more than I love you
See, if I was tryin' to relate it to more people
I'd probably say I'm struggling with loving myself
Because that seems like a common theme
But that's not the case here
I love myself way more than I love you
And I think about killing myself
So, best believe, I thought about killing you today
Premeditated murder

I called up my loved ones, I called up my cousins
I called up the Muslims, said I'm 'bout to go dumb
Get so bright, it's no sun, get so loud, I hear none
Screamed so loud, got no lungs, hurt so bad, I go numb
Time to bring in the drums, that prra-pa-pa-pum
Set the NewTone on 'em, set the nuke off on 'em
I need Coke with no rum, I taste coke on her tongue
I don't joke with no one, they'll say ""He died so young""
I done had a bad case of too many bad days
Got too many bad traits, used the floor for ashtrays
I don't do shit halfway, I'ma clear the cache
I'ma make my name last, put that on my last name

Buckwheat-ass nigga, it's gon' be o-tay
Sorry, but I chose not to be no slave
Young nigga shit, nigga, we don't age
I thought I was past my Deebo ways
Even when I went broke, I ain't break
How you gon' hate? Nigga, we go way back
To when I had the braids and you had the wave cap
Drop a pin for the fade and I'm on my way ASAP
Don't get socked in the mouth, you know homie don't play that
Pay the fire marshal bill 'cause this shit done got way packed

I had debt on my books, it's been a shaky-ass year
Let me make this clear, so all y'all see
I don't take advice from people less successful than me
Hah? Ain't no love lost, but the gloves off
And we up in this bitch until they turn the club off
Had to tell the dogs, ""Turn the snubs off!""
Plus they already mad that the Cubs lost
(Believe it or not) These two wrongs'll right you
(Believe it or not) I was too grown in high school
(Believe it or not) The true soul of Ice Cube
Too close to snipe you, truth told, I like you
Too bold to type you, too rich to fight you
Calm down, you light skin!

You break a glass and say it again
She can't comprehend the danger she in
If you whoop her ass, she move in with him
Then he whoop her ass, you go through it again
But how you the devil rebukin' the sin?
Let's pray we can put this behind us
I swear that these times is the wildest
She got the scars, they serve as reminders
Blood still on her pajamas
But yesterday is dead, yeah, moment of silence
Next, she'll be off to college and then at the altar

Uh-huh, honey

I wanna fuck you hard on the sink
After that, give you somethin' to drink
Step back, can't get spunk on the mink
I mean damn, what would Jeromey Romey Romey Rome think?
Hey, you remember where we first met?
Okay, I don't remember where we first met
But hey, admittin' is the first step
And hey, you know ain't nobody perfect
And I know, with the hoes I got the worst rep
But hey, their backstroke I'm tryna perfect
And hey, ayo, we made it: Thanksgivin'
So hey, maybe we can make it to Christmas
She asked me what I wished for on my wishlist
Have you ever asked your bitch for other bitches?
Maybe we could still make it to the church steps
But first, you gon' remember how to forget
After all these long-ass verses
I'm tired, you tired, Jesus wept

I know you're tired of lovin', of lovin'
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody
So just grab somebody, no leavin' this party
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody
Uh-huh, honey

Jerome's in the house, watch your mouth
Jerome's in the house, watch your mouth
Bound to fall in love
Bound
Bound to fall in love
Bound
Uh-huh, honey"

But before all of these other labels where placed upon him, he was a producer, under the wing of NO ID, thanks to his mother, the late Donda West. After some local success, Ye hit the proverbial jackpot by adding his own touch to Jay Z's classic ""The Blueprint"". From there, West would continue working towards his debut album, ""The College Dropout"", which would change the Gangsta Rap sound of the mainstream to a more gentle, conscious tone.
On Lucifer, one of the tracks from Hov’s The Black Album, West sampled and edited the pitch of Max Romeo’s I Chase The Devil.
Echoing part of a line from Isaiah 14:12 in the Bible initially gives the instrumental a Spiritual feeling to it, but to twist the vocals of the sample (much like he did with Through The Wire) gives it a much more soulful feeling. Add in two or three verses relating to death and vengeance and you have a prime example of West’s intricately contrasting art form; bringing together the righteous connotations of “Lucifer son of the morning, I’m gonna chase you out of earth” and the dark, vengeful tale from Hov’s past. Ye even got a shout out from Jigga for the beat!
Fast-forward to almost a decade later and you have arguably the best single of 2011; Cruel Summer’s Mercy.
Although not solely produced by Ye, this song is also a prime example of West’s iconic production. The Fuzzy Jones sample, which again relies on a Bible verse, is sped up and pitch-edited, making it hard to distinguish what is actually being said by the Dancehall Legend. Then bring in the hook — also supposedly a sample — of pointless braggadocio (Lamborghini Mercy/Yo chick she so thirsty) and the culture-blending contrast between the sample and the actual song speak for themselves.
Next we go backwards a couple of years to West’s epic fairytale-esque My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.
Power, the theme song of West’s self-centric tour de force, has three samples that make it as epic, as powerful as it is, the first of which is found in the chorus and the second of which, the sample that adds the soul of The College Dropout into the mixing pot of defiance and self-righteousness that is so explicitly Kanye West, comes from Continent Number 6’s “Afroamerica”.
Devil In a New Dress, arguably one of Rick Ross' best features, also has the same soulful touch to do it, this time a la the melody and vocal samples of a Smokey Robinson cover of Carole King’s “Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow”.
The irony in the sample is that it’s almost the exact opposite of the song’s lyrical themes, which include decadence (“We love Jesus but you done learned a lot from Satan”) and the ending of his relationship with his ex-fiance, whilst also having a slice of braggadocio, courtesy of Rick Ross (“Lookin at my bitch I bet she’ll give your ass a bone/Lookin at my wrist I bet it’ll turn your ass to stone""). In fact, Devil In a New Dress is probably the perfect example of this exact contrast on Dark Fantasy, but hey, excess is just his character.
The next two songs share common ground, being that they both sample Civil Rights Activist and Soul Singer/Song-Writer Nina Simone. The first of which being the Feeling Good sample on New Day. On a track in which Ye and Hov discuss raising their sons to be better men than themselves the sample may seem misplaced, but the concept of it being a new day may relate to the issues and self-inflection Ye shows on this track, and learning from them, so that his son doesn’t end up like the father. All in all, the track is sentimental and shows a softer side to both rappers.
The next and last song to be looked at is “Blood on the Leaves”, which samples Simone’s rendition of Billie Holiday’s Strange Fruit, initially referenced on New Slaves. The sample’s placement is again questionable and, again, has it’s pitch edited. However, despite any critic’s assessment of it, it is still a display of Ye’s signature style; taking the sacred political message of Strange Fruit and matching it with the horns from TNGHT’s R U Ready and the reflection on past relationships with some light braggadocio (“He instagram his watch like Mad Rich Alert”).
However, due to the nature of certain songs on Yeezus (New Slaves, Black Skinhead) and some of the racially charged content (“My momma was raised in an era when clean water was only served to the fairer skin” and this gem on I’m In It (which again mixes black power imagery with sexual lyrics) may mean that the sample itself was a statement within this song, and also continued the theme of mixing this race-based material with Kanye’s own personal subject matter and lifestyle. At the end of the day only Kanye himself and possibly the producers with him would know the real purpose of this sample but, one thing we do know is that it is definitely his signature style, and we wouldn’t have it any other way."

Our third eon, that's what the fuck we on
Mo' money, 40-year-old phenom
My 15 minutes of fame has stretched beyond
At 42, be better than 24s
I carried the 4-5, mastered 48 laws
Still wearing my 23s, they can't fuck with the boy
As far as them 16s, I'm 23 of it all
Primetime, riding that six-deuce
That 911, I only subtract the roof
I started in '88, got warm in '92
I landed in '96, that's the year I came through
I hit the club, ordered some Grey Goose
Switched it for CÎROC to give Puff's stocks a boost
New money, I found the fountain of youth
I'm headed to Miami to fuck up the Fontainebleau
A case of Ace... make it two
Nigga, we rollin', beat the deuce

Primetime, basking in the lime
Cassius in his prime, coloring out of the line
'Cause they don't want nobody that's colored out of the lines
So I'm late as a motherfucker, colored people time
Damn, Yeezy, they all gotta be dimes?
Well, Adam gave up a rib, so mine better be prime
Niggas gon' kill me, I swear they better be lying
I never live in fear, I'm too out of my mind
Primetime, never hit these heights
I mean it's like, it's like our first first-class flight
I'm tripping on it, socks on marble floors, I'm slipping on it
Champagne, I'm sipping on it, shit tastes different, don't it?
You know what? You right
It's like the best damn champagne I had in my life
""When you coming home?"" That's a text from my wife
I told her run a bubble bath
And float in that motherfucker like a hovercraft
And soak in that motherfucker 'til I call you back
I mean, who says shit like that and doesn't laugh?
Hah...

Heard about at least three killings this afternoon
Looking at the news like, ""Damn! I was just with him after school""
No shop class, but half the school got a tool
And a ""I could die any day""-type attitude
Plus his little brother got shot reppin' his avenue
It’s time for us to stop and redefine black power
Forty-one souls murdered in fifty hours

I dress in Dries, and other boutique stores in Paris
In sheepskin coats, I silence the lambs
Do you know who I am, Clarice?
No cheap cologne whenever I “shh-shh”
Success never smelled so sweet
I stink of success, the new black elite
They say my Black Card bears the mark of the beast
I repeat: my religion is the beat
My verse is like church, my Jesus piece

Only spot a few blacks the higher I go, uh
What’s up to Will? Uh, shout out to O, uh

Yeah, it’s all messed up when it’s nowhere to go
So we won’t take the time out 'til we reach the T-O-P
From parolees that hold G’s, sold keys, low keys
We like the promised land of the OG’s
In the past if you picture events like a black tie
What the last thing you expect to see? Black guys
What’s the life expectancy for black guys?
The system’s working effectively, that’s why
I’ll be a real man, take care of your son
Every problem you had before this day is now done
New crib, watch a movie
'Cause ain’t nothin' on the news but the blues
Hit the mall, pick up some Gucci
Now ain’t nothing new but your shoes

She putting on her make up, she casually allure
Text message break ups, the casualty of tour
How she gon' wake up and not love me no more?
I thought I was the asshole, I guess it's rubbing off
Hood phenomenon, the LeBron of rhyme
Hard to be humble when you stunting on a jumbotron

Throwing shit around, the whole place screwed up
Maybe I should call Mase so he could pray for us

I ordered the jerk, she said you are what you eat

The crib Scarface, could it be more Tony?
You love me for me? Could you be more phony?

Lookin' at my wrist, it'll turn your ass to stone
Stretch limousine, sipping rosé all alone
Double-headed monster with a mind of his own
Cherry-red chariot, excess is just my character
All-black tux, nigga's shoes lavender
I never needed acceptance from all you outsiders
Had cyphers with Yeezy before his mouth wired (Ugh!)
Before his jaw shattered, climbing up the Lord's ladder
We still speeding, running signs like they don't matter
Ugh, hater talking never made me mad
Never that, not when I'm in my favorite papertag
Therefore, G4s at the Clearport
When it come to tools, fool, I'm a Pep Boy
When it came to dope, I was quick to export
Never tired of ballin', so it's on to the next sport
New Mercedes sedan, the Lex sport
So many cars, DMV thought it was mail fraud
Different traps I was getting mail from
Polk County, Jacksonville, rep Melbourne
Whole clique appetites had tapeworms
Spinning Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my J burns
I shed a tear before the night's over
God bless the man I put the sights over
Getting 2Pac money, twice over
Still a real nigga, red Coogi sweater, dice-roller
I'm making love to the angel of death
Catching feelings, never stumble, retracing my steps"

To continue fucking up woke up one night
Digging Paul Revere and Nat Turner as the good guys
America stripped for bed and we had not all yet closed our eyes
The signs of truth were tattooed across our often entered vagina
We learned to our amazement, the untold tale of scandal
Two long centuries buried in the musty vault
Hosed down daily with a gagging perfume
America was a bastard
The illegitimate daughter of the mother country
Whose legs were then spread around the world
And a rapist known as freedom; free-doom
Democracy, liberty, and justice were revolutionary code names
That preceded the bubbling, bubbling, bubbling, bubbling, bubbling

Get arrested guess until he get the message

Bought more jewelry, more Louis V

So when he buried in a tomb full of gold

And what I loved most, she had so much soul
She said, ""Excuse me, little homie, I know you don't know me
But my name is Windy and I like to blow trees.""
And from that point, I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to toe 'em off
And make 'em straighten up their hat 'cause she know they soft
And when I grew up, she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime, her face lit up, so astoundin'
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never messed with entertainers 'cause they always leave
She said, ""It felt like they walked and drove on me.""
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said, ""'Ye, keep makin' that, keep makin' that platinum and gold for me!""

I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again
-Min' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then? Oh!
Now I'm comin' home again
Maybe we can start again

But if you really cared for her
Then you wouldn't've never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her
But when I talk to her, it always seems like she talkin' 'bout me
She said, ""You left your kids, and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you,"" and I just got through
Talkin' 'bout what niggas tryin' to do: just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home
Every interview, I'm representin' you, makin' you proud
Reach for the stars, so if you fall, you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around
If you don't know by now, I'm talkin' 'bout Chi-Town

I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again
-Min' home again
Baby, do you remember when
Fireworks at Lake Michigan? Oh!
Now I'm comin' home again
-Min' home again
Baby, do you remember when
Fireworks at Lake Michigan? Oh!
Now I'm comin' home again
Maybe we can start again

Loy-oy-al, loy-oy-al
Comin' home again
Loy-oy-al, loy-oy-al
Comin' home again
Maybe we can start again"

My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin

It's the Hard Knock Life Tour, sellout
Picture us in the mall, coppin' Iceberg and yell out ""Jigga""
Yeah, that's what we'll yell out, yell out
You know the name do I gotta spell out or tell 'bout
J-A-Y, and 'Ye so shy
Now he won't even step to his idol to say hi
Standing there like a mime and let the chance pass by
Back of my mind, ""He could change your life
With all these beats I did, at least let him hear it
At least you can brag to ya friends back at the gig""
But he got me out my momma crib
Then he help me get my momma a crib

Big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin, begin
Let the story begin
If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands?

Fresh off the plane, I'm off to Baseline
Nothing handed out, I'm 'bout to take mine
'round the same time of that Blueprint 1
And these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for him
I'd play my little songs in that old back room
He'd bob his head and say ""Damn! Oh, that's you?""
But by The Black Album, I was blacking out
Partyin' S.O.B.'s and we had packed a crowd
Big brother got his show up at Madison Square
And I'm like ""Yeah, yeah, we gon' be there"" but
Not only did I not get a chance to spit it
Carline told me I could buy two tickets
I guess big brother was thinkin' a little different
And kept little brother at bay, at a distance
But everything that I felt was more bogus
Only made me more focused, only wrote more potent
Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over
I guess I'll understand when I get more older
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
Now I'm on the top and everybody on the scrotum

My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin, begin
Let the story begin
If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands?

Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant?
Not only a client, the Presidito, hola, Hovito
The game gettin' foul so here's a free throw
I was always on the other side of the peephole
Then I dropped ""Jesus Walks"" now I'm on the steeple
And we know, ""New Jack City""—got to keep my brother
But to be number one I'ma beat my brother
On that ""Diamonds"" remix I swore I spazzed
Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass
Sibling rivalry, only I could see
It was the pride in me that was drivin' me
At the Grammys I said, ""I inspired me""
But my big brother who I always tried to be
When I kicked a flow it was like pick-and-roll
Cause even if he gave me the rock, it's give-and-go
I guess Beanie's style was more of a slam dunk
And my shit was more like a finger roll
But I had them singles though
And them hoes at the show gonna mingle, yo, heh, y'all know
I told Jay I did a song with Coldplay
Next thing I know he got a song with Coldplay
Back in my mind I'm like, ""Damn, no way""
Translate, español: ""No way, José""
Then I went and told Jay Brown
Shoulda known that was gonna come back around
Shoulda talked to you like a man, shoulda told you first
But I told somebody else and that's what made shit worse

My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
So here's a few words from ya kid brother
If you admire somebody you should go on 'head tell 'em
People never get the flowers while they can still smell 'em
A idol in my eyes, god of the game
Heart of the City, Roc-a-Fella chain
Never be the same, never be another
Number one, Young Hov, also my big brother

My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D., my mentor, and that's where the story ends

Toomp killed this shit"

Take me where i can ease my pain
Preacher say boy now where you been?
Getting lead in my pockets
Putting money in sin
When the mornin' comes not a nickel to my name
Threw it all away on the all night train
Ride, let the passenger ride

I woke up late yesterday afternoon
My eyeballs feeling like two balloons
The doctor say things ain't never gonna change

I guess change is good for any of us
Whatever it take for any of y'all niggas to get up out the hood
Shit, I'm wit' ya, I ain't mad at cha
Got nothin' but love for ya, do your thing, boy
Yeah, all the homies that I ain't talk to in a while
I'ma send this one out for y'all
Know what I mean? 'Cause I ain't mad at cha
Heard y'all tearin' up shit out there
Kickin' up dust, givin' a motherfuck
Yeah, niggas, 'cause I ain't mad at cha

Now we was once two niggas of the same kind
Quick to holla at a hoochie with the same line
You was just a little smaller, but you still rolled
Got stretched to Y.A. and hit the hood swoll
'Member when you had a Jheri Curl, didn't quite learn
On the block, wit'cha Glock, trippin' off sherm
Collect calls to the crib, sayin' how you've changed
Oh, you a Muslim now? No more dope game
Heard you might be comin' home, just got bail
Wanna go to the mosque, don't wanna chase tail
It seems I lost my little homie, he's a changed man
Hit the pen and now no sinnin' is the game plan
When I talk about money, all you see is the struggle
When I tell you I'm livin' large, you tell me it's trouble
Congratulations on the weddin', I hope your wife know
She got a playa for life, and that's no bullshittin'
I know we grew apart, you probably don't remember
I used to fiend for your sister, but never went up in her
And I can see us after school, we'd bomb
On the first motherfucker with the wrong shit on
Now the whole shit's changed and we don't even kick it
Got a big money scheme and you ain't even with it
Knew in my heart you was the same motherfucker that
Go toe to toe when it's time to roll, you got a brother's back
And I can't even trip, 'cause I'm just laughin' at cha
You tryin' hard to maintain, then go ahead
'Cause I ain't mad at cha

I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha

We used to be like distant cousins, fightin', playin' dozens
Whole neighborhood buzzin', knowin' that we wasn't
Used to catch us on the roof or behind the stairs
I'm gettin' blitzed and I reminisce on all the times we shared
Besides bumpin' and grindin', wasn't nothin' on our mind
In time, we'd learned to live a life of crime
Rewind us back to a time was much too young to know
I caught a felony, lovin' the way the guns blow
And even though we separated, you said that you'd wait
Don't give nobody no coochie while I'll be locked up state
I kiss my mama goodbye and wipe the tears from her lonely eyes
Said I'll return but I gotta fight, the fate's arrived
Don't shed a tear, 'cause Mama, I ain't happy here
I blew trial, no more smiles for a couple years
They got me goin' mad, I'm knockin' busters on they backs
In my cell, thinkin', ""Hell, I know one day I'll be back""
As soon as I touch down
I told my girl I'd be there, so prepare to get fucked down
The homies wanna kick it, but I'm just laughin' at cha
'Cause you's a down-ass bitch and I ain't mad at cha

I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
A true down-ass bitch and I ain't mad at cha

Well, guess who's movin' up? This nigga's ballin' now
Bitches be callin' to get it, hookers keep fallin' down
He went from nothin' to lots, ten carats to rock
Went from a nobody nigga to the big man on the block
He's Mr. Local-Celebrity, addicted to movin' ki's
Most hated by enemies, escape in the luxury
See, first you was our nigga, but you made it so the choice is made
Now we gotta slay you while you faded, in the younger days
So full of pain while the weapons blaze
Gettin' so high off that bomb, hopin' we make it to the better days
'Cause crime pays, and in time, you'll find a rhyme'll blaze
You'll feel the fire from the niggas in my younger days
So many changed on me, so many tried to plot
That I keep a Glock beside my head, when will it stop?
'Til God return me to my essence
'Cause even as an adolescent, I refused to be a convalescent
So many questions and they ask me if I'm still down
I moved up out of the ghetto, so I ain't real now?
They got so much to say, but I'm just laughin' at cha
You niggas just don't know, but I ain't mad at cha

I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
Hell nah, I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
And I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha

Nuthin' but a gangsta party

Got me up against the fence, back against the wall
Get to actin' like a fool if ain’t no justice for the Dogg
Got to take it out on all, y'all
Better read the papers, all my homies goin' crazy, baby
Only God could save us
Got my, mind on currency, hurry, see I ain't worried
It's a gangsta party so, Bad Boy gettin' buried
Snoop Dogg, why they fantasize
When we ride it’s a must adversaries die every time

Yes, yes, y'all, not $hort but Snoop Dogg
And you know it's like that y'all

I'm so smooth about my paper check it just how it's done
I'm servin' any on a platter Snoop Dogg Corleone
Corleone, now do you know what that mean?
A Teflon Don to this hip-hop game, super supreme
It's like what happen can happen but will it stop
That won't happen I'm feelin' good about the mission for jackin'
*singing*
Ayo Pac, can you feel me?
Why these fools, tryin' to kill me?
*rapping*
It's so hard to stay focused on my eyes and prize
But if I don't, the Dogg won't survive

We ballin' in my opinion, eternal was wild wheel spinnin'
Once implemented it’s represented for five minutes
Two of the livest wanted dead or alive
We riders, ban us cause we inquired and watch the G's ride
Two of America's most, straight out the West Coast
Bow down fool, this is Death Row
Been waitin' way too long, fresh out the pen, now it's on
C'mon, Snoop Dogg, time to bone

Ain't nothin' changed too down to hang I slang a bang with a rhyme
Me and the homey Pac trippin' Death Row on knobs
Gon survive by Eastside of DPG'z
Still creepin bump through the hood, always involved in the streets
(Westside)
Snoop Doggy Dogg homie, did you forget who I was
The big homie to you, there it is and there it was
Now take a look through the eyes of a G
And just ride to the rhythm of a gangsta beat

All my homies tellin' me
Ain't no love for a real G
Straight cowards all you playa haters kill me
Throw up your hands if you feel me
We gettin' dollars, homie, holler if you hear me
It's one time for my comrades doin' bad lockdown
Fresh out bust the top and bounce drop down
Can you visualize perfection
Cause every ryder in my set labelled a vet best in their profession
Don't hold your breath, stick to Smith & Wesson
Steady study your lessons to keep the crowd guessin'

Straight gangsta, y'know
Money to be made, situations get deeper
Niggas always tryin' to creep
But I know what time it is

The F.A's comin striaght from the wild wild west
Look at baby girl born in 19-7-deuce
Pop's on his fix, Mom's stuck on that crazy juice
Went to school, It's all cool but in Junior Hiiigh
Little hooker in the bathroom getting hiiigh
What she doing and what she smoking, nobody knows
Is she addicted or just slipping into melbose
A bad ass broad running with the girl gang
Just got some tat's,Talking all that girl slang
First one to slap, because La vida dont matter
Wip out a cuete watch your brains get splattered
Selling them doves, hanging with thugs and all that
Beating up fools with a baseball bat
Started having sex at only 14
Imagine O.G. wears his clothes all crisp and clean
Got pregnant had a baby in December
She won't see the daddy till next September
Mom's and Pop's gave her the boot
Kicked her out La Casa, Now what Raza
With the money she got, She bought a spot of the block
Started paying the rent by slangin' phat ass coca rocks
Now shes 23 her four kids all alone, and loc'ed out
And plus shes all smoked out,the base face
You could see it in her eyes, it could also tell the tears
Of a life long cries
They was headed for self destruction
Conjunction Junction,(hey Yo!) Whats your Function?
Her own kids gotta healp, 'cause they knew she was slippin'
Took the devil away homegiiirl, You was Slippin'
CHORUS:
Slipping into Darkness
When you slip you trip and fall
Slipping into Darkness
Ain't no sense to give ya'll no love at all
They say we're slipping, as a whole one race
So, what we gonna choose, Don't want the blues
I turn to the news and what do I see
(merciless)""Everybody in the world ready to D. I. E.""
We got blacks against blacks, browns against browns
Whites against whites,from governments to undergrounds
So, Peep the sound as it bumps through your stereo
Ear to your brain now check out the scenerio
Cali got quakes, Mudslides, and Floods
Pesadillas(nightmares)Crips and Bloods
Hustlas, Pimps, Shot Callers, and Killas
O.G. , Macks, and the big Coca Dealers
We got homeboys who just like kicking it
And Vato's like me who grab the mic and start splitting it
(merciless) ""You're in for a phat treat trip into a phat beat""
So get closer to the funk and slip into the backseat
CHORUS X2
They wanna band me cause a brothas makin noise a lot
Ill shoot they ass in a sec wit a poisin dart
They got me runnin down the street gettin hotter
Runnin from the cops as i try to clock my Glock
The war won't stop
Thats why they wanna band the music
You ever notcie how the cops can't stand the music
See a black man coolin wit a mexican
We can all have peace, the sun sets again
They try to shove us in the pen
But we clown and we frown every time we hit the top ten
Once again, its your friend outta oakland,hopin
To keep the hip hop clubs open
Now we can lay back and let them close'm
Or we can have beef and show that we control'em
Now ain't nobody gettin paid, its a damn shame
Why gang bang brothas in the same gang?
They say securitys to blame, cause they lettin it off
Brothas come to have fun but they settin it off
One time, make it worse when they sweat us
Send an army of pigs to come get us
Now im runnin outta time and im cool down with the aztecs
This is sorta like soul food"

Step up the game but they never call shit, come on
Steadily working a nigga fillin' up the funnel
A couple of years ago I was somebody to front on
Now they see the kid and they tellin' me I should come on
But I ain't done shit, nah
I stayed on my shit, yah
I just spaced, I been gone
Pedaled through the nonsense
Knowledge got the shit that get into a nigga's conscience
Knowledge been killing shit but never give no responses
Knowledge kept it real while you was looking for responsive
Third-person, I speak, I speak
I work hard when you sleep, you sleep
I thank God that I'm me, I'm me
I thank God that I'm me, I'm me
Cause I don't wanna meet you niggas anyway
So when I listen to your shit I don't hear anything
It's just repetitive banter
With similar stanzas
And ignorant grammar
I might need glasses
Cause I don't see how that's dope
It's not
Just leave me alone while I play

Honestly there's only couple people I can trust
Back and forth in my head what a rush
Chasin' what I love but the lusts what I want
Livin' life loud
You should try it
Me and K.A.A.N hungry like we both on a diet
Going against giants
Most don't advise it
When it's unlikely
Don't be self-righteous
Don't let that pride  after the fall
Show me that light like Jesus did Paul
Give me a reason that's reason to ball
Look past the hype and you'll see all the flaws
Feel it from the feet to your knees to your jaw
Bout to do some things they ain't seen thus far

Don't you want a large love

I ain't seen it in a minute
My sanity's non-existent
A penny for the thoughts I'm writing down but you will listen
Instead these niggas give me no credit like Scottie Pippen
And say it's trash cause I'm different, fuck em

I tried my best to take the high road
But I don't know the address to the high road
So I got to come at ya
I tried to bury the hatchet
I went and shook your hand and said you're doing a great job this year

Stop man, leave me alone

A picture of perfection, the object of a nigga affection
Partners in passionate sex, a place to put my erection
Fantasies of you in submission, freaky positions
Pushin', pullin' and twistin' I'm on a mission got me on the mash
Tried to dig, you was screamin' when I did
Steady yellin' out spots for me to hit, and ""aw shit""
Soon as I seen her saw us playin' hide the weiner
Wanna ""Freak Like Me"", fuck Adina
Up and down is the object, side to side
Make you holla out my name when a thug nigga ride, ""Can I cum inside?""
Say you don't feel it that's a lie
You just scared to get this penitentiary dick
The trot caught your eye when I walked by
I said, ""Hi""
But you was so shy, I can't lie, damn near stuttered when you walked by
You want me to lick it and even worse
Got your heart set on me goin' first, and that ain't no fair exchange

You do me
And if it's worth it baby, I'll return the favor
And give it back to you (give it to you, give it to you)
A fair exchange, on everythang
And Let me tell you that's the way it's gotta be
Open your eyes baby, recognize a player
Give it up to me (give it to me give it to me)
A fair exchange, you know the game
We can do the damn thang, thang, thang

Open your legs
Got me marchin' like it’s a million, you tremble from the feelin'
Look up, 'cause I got mirrors on the ceilin'
And if you willin', then we can ride until the sun shine
And just for fun, I betchu I can make you cum 61 times
Close your eyes, let me heat it up
'Cause when we fuck I refuse to bust a nut until I beat it up
Drop the top, time to fuck while the wind blow
Baby throw yo' legs out the window
Remember on the balcony, bend over baby bounce on me
And let me hit it where it counts and flee
Remember me? ""I Get Around,"" and I'm haunted by my ""Temptations""
Sexual participation, my motivation
Even though I like the way you work it
You don't deserve it 'cause you walk around actin' like you perfect
Took a while but I finally got it, and like a boss player

Now yo' attitude ain't realistic
Yeah it's true I'm gettin' pussy, but baby you gettin' dick!
And since you bein' laced with the penetration
It's only right to show a form of appreciation
Instead of fakin' like you can't hear the bed shakin'
In bed naked you so twisted think yo' legs breakin'
You said ""take it"" so I'm blind in my passion, how long will I last?
Doggy style steady pumpin' on that ass, until I blast
And then I laugh as we lay back
See I wait 'til you asleep and that's the payback
'Cause you actin' like you did somethin', givin' me a piece
I had you mufflin' your screams in the sheets, fuckin' with me
A true digger that love triggers, a thug nigga
Hustlin' bitches like drug dealers
Before I say goodbye, put an end to all the games

Fiendin' for money and alcohol, the life of a Westside player
Where cowards die and the strong ball
Only in Cali where we riot, not rally, to live and die
In L.A. we wearin' Chucks, not Ballys (yeah, that's right)
Dressed in Locs and Khaki suits, and ride is what we do
Flossin' but have caution: we collide with other crews
Famous because we throw grams

Bumpin' and grindin' like a slow jam
It's Westside, so you know the Row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say, but give me that bomb beat from Dre

In the same motherfuckin' place at the same motherfuckin' time?

Picture perfect, I paint a perfect picture
Bomb the hoochies with precision, my intention's to get richer
With the S-N double-O-P, Dogg, my fuckin' homie
You's a cold-ass nigga on them hogs

Sure 'nough, I keep my hand on my gun
'Cause they got me on the run
Now I'm back in the courtroom, waitin' on the outcome
""Free 2Pac"" is all that's on a nigga's mind
But at the same time, it seems they tryin' to take mine
So I'ma get smart and get defensive and shit
And put together a Million March for some gangsta shit

So now they got us laced
Two multi-millionaire motherfuckers catchin' cases
Bitches get ready for the throw down, the shit's about to go down
Me and Snoop about to clown
I'm losin' my religion, I'm vicious on these stool pigeons
You might be deep in this game, but you got the rules missin'
Niggas be actin' like they savage, they out to get the cabbage
I've got nothin' but love for my niggas livin' lavish

I've got a pit named Petey, she Nigerina
I've got a house out in the hills right next to Chino
And I think I've got a black Bimmer
But my dream is to own a fly casino
Like Bugsy Siegel, and do it all legal
And get scooped up by the little homie in the Regal
It feels good to you, baby-bubba
You see, this is for the G's and the keys, motherfucker

Now follow as we ride
Motherfuck the rest, two of the best from the Westside
And I can make you famous
Niggas been dyin' for years, so how could they blame us?
I live in fear of a felony
I never stop bailin' these motherfuckin' G's
If you got it, better flaunt it

Defeat is not my destiny, release me to the streets
And keep whatever's left of me
Jealousy is misery, sufferin' is greed
Better be prepared when you cowards fuck with me
I bust and flee, these niggas must be crazy, what?
There ain't no mercy motherfuckers who can't fade the thugs
You thought it was, but it wasn't, now disappear
Bow down in the presence of a boss player

It's like Cuzz, Blood, gang-bangin'
Everybody in the party doin' dope-slangin'
You gotta have papers in this world
You might get your first snatch before your eyes swirl
You doin' your job every day
And then you work so hard 'til your hair turns gray
Let me tell you 'bout life and 'bout the way it is
You see, we live by the gun, so we die by the guns, kids

They tell me not to roll with my Glock
So now I got a throw-away
Floatin' in the black Benz (Bitch), tryin' to do a show a day
They wonder how I live with five shots
Niggas is hard to kill on my block
Schemes for currency and dough-related
Affiliated with the hustlers, so we made it
No answers to questions, I'm tryin' to get up on it
My nigga Dogg wit' me, eternally the most wanted

They can't cope with these two M.C.s
That proceed to rock you
Ace, they wanna battle, man they can't stop you
Word, that's what I said, and it's a proven fact
That these suckas couldn't stop me with a baseball bat
And If I gave them a bomb, that was nuclear-armed
They can shoot it at my posse, and we wouldn't get harmed
When I first wrote it down, ask Ace how it sounds?
Just shook and said slowly and said

Who rocks from my side ?pro? street
So we feed the dope rhymes they provide
No one ever—

Taken us and you'll get took in out
On a stretcher with your microphone shoved in your mouth
Thinking back MC New York, do you remember that clown?
Which he tried dissing you and you got pissed and said—

That's my man throwing down
That's my man throwing down
That's my man throwing down

Don't mean to brag, but it's like that
If there's a problem, we fight the battles back to back
If there's a challenge from a crew or a posse
No need to worry, I know Ace has got me
And that's my man, I repeat it 'cause I mean it
He hold it inside sometimes, I wanna scream it out loud
To every crowd, I say it proud everywhere
Don't need a gun, my knowledge is right here
And that's my man
If things get out of hand, we stick together
Through thick and thin, that's the plan
Yo Ace, let's shake the bass, so we place
In this town, if you don't know, here we go

That's my man throwing down
That's my man throwing down
That's my man throwing down

And busts a bottle, when I saying I'm a playa
So suckas, won't doubt it
That that's my man
Say that to the bank
'Cause I put money down the jeweller
That he holds rank with
Whenever static get raw, I don't freeze but get thaw
'Cause since New York is around
I don't have to look far, I keep the odds even
And just in case it gets out of hand
He say what's up, I say what's up
And that's my man
He like the barricade, no renegade can get through him
And for me, I guarantee that he'll go out on a limb
And since our posse was found today
I can say now we standing tall, never fall
'Cause

Pop's on his fix, Mom's stuck on that crazy juice
Went to school, It's all cool but in Junior Hiiigh
Little hooker in the bathroom getting hiiigh
What she doing and what she smoking, nobody knows
Is she addicted or just slipping into melbose
A bad ass broad running with the girl gang
Just got some tat's,Talking all that girl slang
First one to slap, because La vida dont matter
Wip out a cuete watch your brains get splattered
Selling them doves, hanging with thugs and all that
Beating up fools with a baseball bat
Started having sex at only 14
Imagine O.G. wears his clothes all crisp and clean
Got pregnant had a baby in December
She won't see the daddy till next September
Mom's and Pop's gave her the boot
Kicked her out La Casa, Now what Raza
With the money she got, She bought a spot of the block
Started paying the rent by slangin' phat ass coca rocks
Now shes 23 her four kids all alone, and loc'ed out
And plus shes all smoked out,the base face
You could see it in her eyes, it could also tell the tears
Of a life long cries
They was headed for self destruction
Conjunction Junction,(hey Yo!) Whats your Function?
Her own kids gotta healp, 'cause they knew she was slippin'
Took the devil away homegiiirl, You was Slippin'

Slipping into Darkness
When you slip you trip and fall
Slipping into Darkness
Ain't no sense to give ya'll no love at all
They say we're slipping, as a whole one race
So, what we gonna choose, Don't want the blues
I turn to the news and what do I see
(merciless)""Everybody in the world ready to D. I. E.""
We got blacks against blacks, browns against browns
Whites against whites,from governments to undergrounds
So, Peep the sound as it bumps through your stereo
Ear to your brain now check out the scenerio
Cali got quakes, Mudslides, and Floods
Pesadillas(nightmares)Crips and Bloods
Hustlas, Pimps, Shot Callers, and Killas
O.G. , Macks, and the big Coca Dealers
We got homeboys who just like kicking it
And Vato's like me who grab the mic and start splitting it

So get closer to the funk and slip into the backseat
CHORUS X2
They wanna band me cause a brothas makin noise a lot
Ill shoot they ass in a sec wit a poisin dart
They got me runnin down the street gettin hotter
Runnin from the cops as i try to clock my Glock
The war won't stop
Thats why they wanna band the music
You ever notcie how the cops can't stand the music
See a black man coolin wit a mexican
We can all have peace, the sun sets again
They try to shove us in the pen
But we clown and we frown every time we hit the top ten
Once again, its your friend outta oakland,hopin
To keep the hip hop clubs open
Now we can lay back and let them close'm
Or we can have beef and show that we control'em
Now ain't nobody gettin paid, its a damn shame
Why gang bang brothas in the same gang?
They say securitys to blame, cause they lettin it off
Brothas come to have fun but they settin it off
One time, make it worse when they sweat us
Send an army of pigs to come get us

I guess change is good for any of us
Whatever it take for any of y'all niggas to get up out the hood
Shit, I'm wit' ya, I ain't mad at cha
Got nothin' but love for ya, do your thing, boy
Yeah, all the homies that I ain't talk to in a while
I'ma send this one out for y'all
Know what I mean? 'Cause I ain't mad at cha
Heard y'all tearin' up shit out there
Kickin' up dust, givin' a motherfuck
Yeah, niggas, 'cause I ain't mad at cha

Now we was once two niggas of the same kind
Quick to holla at a hoochie with the same line
You was just a little smaller, but you still rolled
Got stretched to Y.A. and hit the hood swoll
'Member when you had a Jheri Curl, didn't quite learn
On the block, wit'cha Glock, trippin' off sherm
Collect calls to the crib, sayin' how you've changed
Oh, you a Muslim now? No more dope game
Heard you might be comin' home, just got bail
Wanna go to the mosque, don't wanna chase tail
It seems I lost my little homie, he's a changed man
Hit the pen and now no sinnin' is the game plan
When I talk about money, all you see is the struggle
When I tell you I'm livin' large, you tell me it's trouble
Congratulations on the weddin', I hope your wife know
She got a playa for life, and that's no bullshittin'
I know we grew apart, you probably don't remember
I used to fiend for your sister, but never went up in her
And I can see us after school, we'd bomb
On the first motherfucker with the wrong shit on
Now the whole shit's changed and we don't even kick it
Got a big money scheme and you ain't even with it
Knew in my heart you was the same motherfucker that
Go toe to toe when it's time to roll, you got a brother's back
And I can't even trip, 'cause I'm just laughin' at cha
You tryin' hard to maintain, then go ahead
'Cause I ain't mad at cha

I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha

We used to be like distant cousins, fightin', playin' dozens
Whole neighborhood buzzin', knowin' that we wasn't
Used to catch us on the roof or behind the stairs
I'm gettin' blitzed and I reminisce on all the times we shared
Besides bumpin' and grindin', wasn't nothin' on our mind
In time, we'd learned to live a life of crime
Rewind us back to a time was much too young to know
I caught a felony, lovin' the way the guns blow
And even though we separated, you said that you'd wait
Don't give nobody no coochie while I'll be locked up state
I kiss my mama goodbye and wipe the tears from her lonely eyes
Said I'll return but I gotta fight, the fate's arrived
Don't shed a tear, 'cause Mama, I ain't happy here
I blew trial, no more smiles for a couple years
They got me goin' mad, I'm knockin' busters on they backs
In my cell, thinkin', ""Hell, I know one day I'll be back""
As soon as I touch down
I told my girl I'd be there, so prepare to get fucked down
The homies wanna kick it, but I'm just laughin' at cha
'Cause you's a down-ass bitch and I ain't mad at cha

I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
A true down-ass bitch and I ain't mad at cha

Well, guess who's movin' up? This nigga's ballin' now
Bitches be callin' to get it, hookers keep fallin' down
He went from nothin' to lots, ten carats to rock
Went from a nobody nigga to the big man on the block
He's Mr. Local-Celebrity, addicted to movin' ki's
Most hated by enemies, escape in the luxury
See, first you was our nigga, but you made it so the choice is made
Now we gotta slay you while you faded, in the younger days
So full of pain while the weapons blaze
Gettin' so high off that bomb, hopin' we make it to the better days
'Cause crime pays, and in time, you'll find a rhyme'll blaze
You'll feel the fire from the niggas in my younger days
So many changed on me, so many tried to plot
That I keep a Glock beside my head, when will it stop?
'Til God return me to my essence
'Cause even as an adolescent, I refused to be a convalescent
So many questions and they ask me if I'm still down
I moved up out of the ghetto, so I ain't real now?
They got so much to say, but I'm just laughin' at cha
You niggas just don't know, but I ain't mad at cha

I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
Hell nah, I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
And I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha

Nigga kingdom and shit, basically, know what I'm saying?
I was like, this is like a fucking election
It is that
You know what I am saying
Me and Biggie's situation is smaller than that, it's like…

And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead?
Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?
(You don't know)
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?

Check it, I grew up a fuckin' screw-up
Got introduced to the game, got a ounce and fuckin' blew up
Choppin' rocks overnight
The nigga Biggie Smalls tryna turn into the black Frank White
We had to grow dreads to change our description
Two cops is on the milk box missin'
Show they toes, you know they got stepped on
A fistful of bullets, a chest full of Teflon
Runnin' from the police, picture that
Nigga, I'm too fat, I fuck around and catch a asthma attack
That's why I bust back, it don't faze me
When he drop, take his Glock and I'm Swayze
Celebrate my escape, sold the Glock, bought some weight
Lay back, I got some money to make, motherfucker

And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead?
Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?
(It's on me)

But still I'm havin' memories of high speed when the cops crashed
As I laugh, pushin' the gas while my Glocks blast
We was young and we was dumb, but we had heart
In the dark, will we survive through the bad parts?
Many dreams is what I had, and plenty wishes
No hesitation in extermination of these snitches
Envious bitches, they still continue to pursue me
A couple of movies, now the whole world's tryna screw me
Even the cops tried to sue me, so what can I do?
But stay true, sippin' 22's of brew
And now media is tryna test me
Got the press askin' questions, tryna stress me
Misery is all I see, that's my mind state
My history with the police will shake the crime rate
My main man had two strikes, slipped, got arrested, and flipped
He screamed ""Thug Life!"" and emptied the clip
Got tired of runnin' from the police

And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead?
Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?

They wanted a new regime. And my regime includes East coast, includes West coast

I was more shocked than anything
You know what I'm sayin'?
But I wasn't more shocked of him dying
I was more shocked of him… Pac is a strong dude, yo
I know dude, you know what I'm sayin'? Real strong
So when they was like he got shot, I was just more like, ""Again?"" you know what I'm sayin'?
He always getting shot, or shot at
He going to pull through this one again
Make a few records about it, and it's going to be over
You know what I'm sayin'?
But when he, when he died, I was just like, ""whoa"", you know what I'm saying? Kinda took me by
I mean, even though we was going through our drama
I would never wish death on nobody
You know what I'm sayin'?
Because there ain't no coming back from that"

I remember '85, that's when the crack would come
A lot of niggas got rich, but most these niggas got stung
With years under they built, tryna feel what it felt
To be the nig, watch the ice that don't melt;
'86 through '88 the game got bigger, we done hit the block
Swatting baby ninjas on our way to school
Park my shit around the corner so fly so cool
Young niggas, Brooklyn breed emcees, the Bay breed drug dealers
You got a youngster that flows, I got a young nigga
That push coke plus he got hoes, stay on the road
He can't understand life but grab the mic and make the track explode...

And you know I'm from the Bay
Mothafuckin A-R-E-A
Yahmean
No other place I'd rather be...
And you know I tried to flee
To another mothafuckin scene
Yahmean
It wasn't thug enough for me...

On my way to the port to drop my nigga Cormega
On Too $hort birthday plus all the Figaz together
The boys put us on the weight to hustle out up in the weather
Yup, '85 turned out, hit the corner here
Then hit me on my burn-out, when you niggas gon learn bout
The mothafuckin bay, it's superthug where I stay
From Frisco, North Richmond to O-A-K
Central, South Richmond and EPA
Pittsburg got the coke for a price you must pay
Yeah boy, believe what they say
Ain't nothing scarier than the Bay, high-speeds every day
Adolescents tuck weapons, niggas bleed every day
You got to have heart just to visit where I stay
And I been everywhere, ain't nothing thugger than me
Yo, we live the shit that you see on TV
Word...
(hook)

Fuck 'em, one time, like hitters on the payroll
Hits on the streets, the radio don't never play so
Don't nobody know who the real niggas is
I dedicate this rap to the mothafuckin Figz
3X Krazy Askari-X, The Click
Messcalene, JT The Bigga Figga
Tha Gamblaz, them my niggas, The Young D Boyz
Mac Mall, Neva Legal, Sick Insane, Lil Ric
Mr. Brave, The Hoodfellaz, Sincydal
San Quinn, Mac Dre, Willie Hen, Too $hort
Fatha Dom, Lil Bruce, Mac Shawn, RBL
11/5, Guce, Sandman and P-O-D-E
Can't forget G-O-V, and Seagram rest in peace
And Rappin' Ron rest in peace too, I got my ear
To the streets too, this for the Yay, and they never could
Defeat you; The Ghetto Starz, Big Block and Richie Rich
2Pac and 5150 was the shit
So was Digital Underground and Souls of Mischief, Spice-1
Poohman, Dangerous Dame, and Young Cellski
C-Bo, Yukmouth and Nutty-B, you out-of-towners
Study me, want me to show you how you should be
You niggas thugs now but we been that
And I'm the proof cause now it's back where it begin at...

Eh, light that up, Snoop! Why you actin' like that?
Ahh shit, you done fucked up now
(Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
You done put two of America's most wanted
In the same motherfuckin' place at the same motherfuckin' time?
(Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
Ha, ha, ha, ha, y'all niggas about to feel this
(Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
Break out the champagne glasses and the motherfuckin' condoms
Have one on us, a'ight?
(Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
A toast to the gangsters

Picture perfect, I paint a perfect picture
Bomb the hoochies with precision, my intention's to get richer
With the S-N double-O-P, Dogg, my fuckin' homie
You's a cold-ass nigga on them hogs

Sure 'nough, I keep my hand on my gun
'Cause they got me on the run
Now I'm back in the courtroom, waitin' on the outcome
""Free 2Pac"" is all that's on a nigga's mind
But at the same time, it seems they tryin' to take mine
So I'ma get smart and get defensive and shit
And put together a Million March for some gangsta shit

So now they got us laced
Two multi-millionaire motherfuckers catchin' cases
Bitches get ready for the throw down, the shit's about to go down
Me and Snoop about to clown
I'm losin' my religion, I'm vicious on these stool pigeons
You might be deep in this game, but you got the rules missin'
Niggas be actin' like they savage, they out to get the cabbage
I've got nothin' but love for my niggas livin' lavish

I've got a pit named Petey, she Nigerina
I've got a house out in the hills right next to Chino
And I think I've got a black Bimmer
But my dream is to own a fly casino
Like Bugsy Siegel, and do it all legal
And get scooped up by the little homie in the Regal
It feels good to you, baby-bubba
You see, this is for the G's and the keys, motherfucker

Now follow as we ride
Motherfuck the rest, two of the best from the Westside
And I can make you famous
Niggas been dyin' for years, so how could they blame us?
I live in fear of a felony
I never stop bailin' these motherfuckin' G's
If you got it, better flaunt it
Another warrant, two of America's most wanted

Now give me fifty feet
Defeat is not my destiny, release me to the streets
And keep whatever's left of me
Jealousy is misery, sufferin' is greed
Better be prepared when you cowards fuck with me
I bust and flee, these niggas must be crazy, what?
There ain't no mercy motherfuckers who can't fade the thugs
You thought it was, but it wasn't, now disappear
Bow down in the presence of a boss player

It's like Cuzz, Blood, gang-bangin'
Everybody in the party doin' dope-slangin'
You gotta have papers in this world
You might get your first snatch before your eyes swirl
You doin' your job every day
And then you work so hard 'til your hair turns gray
Let me tell you 'bout life and 'bout the way it is
You see, we live by the gun, so we die by the guns, kids

They tell me not to roll with my Glock
So now I got a throw-away
Floatin' in the black Benz (Bitch), tryin' to do a show a day
They wonder how I live with five shots
Niggas is hard to kill on my block
Schemes for currency and dough-related
Affiliated with the hustlers, so we made it
No answers to questions, I'm tryin' to get up on it
My nigga Dogg wit' me, eternally the most wanted

The state where you never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean mean money-making-machines servin' fiends

Ever since honeys was wearin' Sassoon

Only in Cali where we riot, not rally, to live and die
In L.A. we wearin' Chucks, not Ballys (yeah, that's right)
Dressed in Locs and Khaki suits, and ride is what we do
Flossin' but have caution: we collide with other crews
Famous because we throw grams
Worldwide, let them recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumpin' and grindin' like a slow jam
It's Westside, so you know the Row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say, but give me that bomb beat from Dre

The F.A's comin striaght from the wild wild west
Look at baby girl born in 19-7-deuce
Pop's on his fix, Mom's stuck on that crazy juice
Went to school, It's all cool but in Junior Hiiigh
Little hooker in the bathroom getting hiiigh
What she doing and what she smoking, nobody knows
Is she addicted or just slipping into melbose
A bad ass broad running with the girl gang
Just got some tat's,Talking all that girl slang
First one to slap, because La vida dont matter
Wip out a cuete watch your brains get splattered
Selling them doves, hanging with thugs and all that
Beating up fools with a baseball bat
Started having sex at only 14
Imagine O.G. wears his clothes all crisp and clean
Got pregnant had a baby in December
She won't see the daddy till next September
Mom's and Pop's gave her the boot
Kicked her out La Casa, Now what Raza
With the money she got, She bought a spot of the block
Started paying the rent by slangin' phat ass coca rocks
Now shes 23 her four kids all alone, and loc'ed out
And plus shes all smoked out,the base face
You could see it in her eyes, it could also tell the tears
Of a life long cries
They was headed for self destruction
Conjunction Junction,(hey Yo!) Whats your Function?
Her own kids gotta healp, 'cause they knew she was slippin'
Took the devil away homegiiirl, You was Slippin'
CHORUS:
Slipping into Darkness
When you slip you trip and fall
Slipping into Darkness
Ain't no sense to give ya'll no love at all
They say we're slipping, as a whole one race
So, what we gonna choose, Don't want the blues
I turn to the news and what do I see
(merciless)""Everybody in the world ready to D. I. E.""
We got blacks against blacks, browns against browns
Whites against whites,from governments to undergrounds
So, Peep the sound as it bumps through your stereo
Ear to your brain now check out the scenerio
Cali got quakes, Mudslides, and Floods
Pesadillas(nightmares)Crips and Bloods
Hustlas, Pimps, Shot Callers, and Killas
O.G. , Macks, and the big Coca Dealers
We got homeboys who just like kicking it
And Vato's like me who grab the mic and start splitting it
(merciless) ""You're in for a phat treat trip into a phat beat""
So get closer to the funk and slip into the backseat
CHORUS X2
They wanna band me cause a brothas makin noise a lot
Ill shoot they ass in a sec wit a poisin dart
They got me runnin down the street gettin hotter
Runnin from the cops as i try to clock my Glock
The war won't stop
Thats why they wanna band the music
You ever notcie how the cops can't stand the music
See a black man coolin wit a mexican
We can all have peace, the sun sets again
They try to shove us in the pen
But we clown and we frown every time we hit the top ten
Once again, its your friend outta oakland,hopin
To keep the hip hop clubs open
Now we can lay back and let them close'm
Or we can have beef and show that we control'em
Now ain't nobody gettin paid, its a damn shame
Why gang bang brothas in the same gang?
They say securitys to blame, cause they lettin it off
Brothas come to have fun but they settin it off
One time, make it worse when they sweat us
Send an army of pigs to come get us
Now im runnin outta time and im cool down with the aztecs
This is sorta like soul food"

Shit, I'm wit' ya, I ain't mad at cha
Got nothin' but love for ya, do your thing, boy
Yeah, all the homies that I ain't talk to in a while
I'ma send this one out for y'all
Know what I mean? 'Cause I ain't mad at cha
Heard y'all tearin' up shit out there
Kickin' up dust, givin' a motherfuck
Yeah, niggas, 'cause I ain't mad at cha

Now we was once two niggas of the same kind
Quick to holla at a hoochie with the same line
You was just a little smaller, but you still rolled
Got stretched to Y.A. and hit the hood swoll
'Member when you had a Jheri Curl, didn't quite learn
On the block, wit'cha Glock, trippin' off sherm
Collect calls to the crib, sayin' how you've changed
Oh, you a Muslim now? No more dope game
Heard you might be comin' home, just got bail
Wanna go to the mosque, don't wanna chase tail
It seems I lost my little homie, he's a changed man
Hit the pen and now no sinnin' is the game plan
When I talk about money, all you see is the struggle
When I tell you I'm livin' large, you tell me it's trouble
Congratulations on the weddin', I hope your wife know
She got a playa for life, and that's no bullshittin'
I know we grew apart, you probably don't remember
I used to fiend for your sister, but never went up in her
And I can see us after school, we'd bomb
On the first motherfucker with the wrong shit on
Now the whole shit's changed and we don't even kick it
Got a big money scheme and you ain't even with it
Knew in my heart you was the same motherfucker that
Go toe to toe when it's time to roll, you got a brother's back
And I can't even trip, 'cause I'm just laughin' at cha
You tryin' hard to maintain, then go ahead
'Cause I ain't mad at cha

I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha

We used to be like distant cousins, fightin', playin' dozens
Whole neighborhood buzzin', knowin' that we wasn't
Used to catch us on the roof or behind the stairs
I'm gettin' blitzed and I reminisce on all the times we shared
Besides bumpin' and grindin', wasn't nothin' on our mind
In time, we'd learned to live a life of crime
Rewind us back to a time was much too young to know
I caught a felony, lovin' the way the guns blow
And even though we separated, you said that you'd wait
Don't give nobody no coochie while I'll be locked up state
I kiss my mama goodbye and wipe the tears from her lonely eyes
Said I'll return but I gotta fight, the fate's arrived
Don't shed a tear, 'cause Mama, I ain't happy here
I blew trial, no more smiles for a couple years
They got me goin' mad, I'm knockin' busters on they backs
In my cell, thinkin', ""Hell, I know one day I'll be back""
As soon as I touch down
I told my girl I'd be there, so prepare to get fucked down
The homies wanna kick it, but I'm just laughin' at cha
'Cause you's a down-ass bitch and I ain't mad at cha

I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
A true down-ass bitch and I ain't mad at cha

Well, guess who's movin' up? This nigga's ballin' now
Bitches be callin' to get it, hookers keep fallin' down
He went from nothin' to lots, ten carats to rock
Went from a nobody nigga to the big man on the block
He's Mr. Local-Celebrity, addicted to movin' ki's
Most hated by enemies, escape in the luxury
See, first you was our nigga, but you made it so the choice is made
Now we gotta slay you while you faded, in the younger days
So full of pain while the weapons blaze
Gettin' so high off that bomb, hopin' we make it to the better days
'Cause crime pays, and in time, you'll find a rhyme'll blaze
You'll feel the fire from the niggas in my younger days
So many changed on me, so many tried to plot
That I keep a Glock beside my head, when will it stop?
'Til God return me to my essence
'Cause even as an adolescent, I refused to be a convalescent
So many questions and they ask me if I'm still down
I moved up out of the ghetto, so I ain't real now?
They got so much to say, but I'm just laughin' at cha
You niggas just don't know, but I ain't mad at cha

I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
Hell nah, I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
And I ain't mad at cha

Me and Biggie's situation is smaller than that, it's like…

And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead?
Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?
(You don't know)
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?

Check it, I grew up a fuckin' screw-up
Got introduced to the game, got a ounce and fuckin' blew up
Choppin' rocks overnight
The nigga Biggie Smalls tryna turn into the black Frank White
We had to grow dreads to change our description
Two cops is on the milk box missin'
Show they toes, you know they got stepped on
A fistful of bullets, a chest full of Teflon
Runnin' from the police, picture that
Nigga, I'm too fat, I fuck around and catch a asthma attack
That's why I bust back, it don't faze me
When he drop, take his Glock and I'm Swayze
Celebrate my escape, sold the Glock, bought some weight
Lay back, I got some money to make, motherfucker

Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?

But still I'm havin' memories of high speed when the cops crashed
As I laugh, pushin' the gas while my Glocks blast
We was young and we was dumb, but we had heart
In the dark, will we survive through the bad parts?
Many dreams is what I had, and plenty wishes
No hesitation in extermination of these snitches
Envious bitches, they still continue to pursue me
A couple of movies, now the whole world's tryna screw me
Even the cops tried to sue me, so what can I do?
But stay true, sippin' 22's of brew
And now media is tryna test me
Got the press askin' questions, tryna stress me
Misery is all I see, that's my mind state
My history with the police will shake the crime rate
My main man had two strikes, slipped, got arrested, and flipped
He screamed ""Thug Life!"" and emptied the clip
Got tired of runnin' from the police

And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead?
Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?

They wanted a new regime. And my regime includes East coast, includes West coast

I was more shocked than anything
You know what I'm sayin'?
But I wasn't more shocked of him dying
I was more shocked of him… Pac is a strong dude, yo
I know dude, you know what I'm sayin'? Real strong
So when they was like he got shot, I was just more like, ""Again?"" you know what I'm sayin'?
He always getting shot, or shot at
He going to pull through this one again
Make a few records about it, and it's going to be over
You know what I'm sayin'?
But when he, when he died, I was just like, ""whoa"", you know what I'm saying? Kinda took me by
I mean, even though we was going through our drama
I would never wish death on nobody

The boys put us on the weight to hustle out up in the weather
Yup, '85 turned out, hit the corner here
Then hit me on my burn-out, when you niggas gon learn bout

Central, South Richmond and EPA
Pittsburg got the coke for a price you must pay

Two multi-millionaire motherfuckers catchin' cases
Bitches get ready for the throw down, the shit's about to go down
Me and Snoop about to clown
I'm losin' my religion, I'm vicious on these stool pigeons
You might be deep in this game, but you got the rules missin'

I've got nothin' but love for my niggas livin' lavish

I've got a pit named Petey, she Nigerina
I've got a house out in the hills right next to Chino
And I think I've got a black Bimmer
But my dream is to own a fly casino
Like Bugsy Siegel, and do it all legal
And get scooped up by the little homie in the Regal
It feels good to you, baby-bubba
You see, this is for the G's and the keys, motherfucker

Now follow as we ride
Motherfuck the rest, two of the best from the Westside
And I can make you famous
Niggas been dyin' for years, so how could they blame us?

Better be prepared when you cowards fuck with me
I bust and flee, these niggas must be crazy, what?
There ain't no mercy motherfuckers who can't fade the thugs
You thought it was, but it wasn't, now disappear
Bow down in the presence of a boss player

It's like Cuzz, Blood, gang-bangin'
Everybody in the party doin' dope-slangin'
You gotta have papers in this world
You might get your first snatch before your eyes swirl
You doin' your job every day
And then you work so hard 'til your hair turns gray
Let me tell you 'bout life and 'bout the way it is
You see, we live by the gun, so we die by the guns, kids

They tell me not to roll with my Glock
So now I got a throw-away
Floatin' in the black Benz (Bitch), tryin' to do a show a day
They wonder how I live with five shots
Niggas is hard to kill on my block

Yo, check this out
I need a verse from each of y'all and I'mma do a verse

So what really goes on
So what really goes on
So what really goes on

Mama raised me crazy
Critics should've killed me as a baby
Cause now I'm 21, you can't fade me
Yeah, I'm gettin' major paid, check my pager
Poppin' mo' game than a Sega
Sharp as a razor
Rollin' Cherokee and not a Blazer
Fuck the 5-0, watch for lasers
Infrared beam boomin' at ya dome cause it's on
One shot from the Glock and he's gone
Tell me: what goes on in the city?
That's colder than a dope fiend's titty
Testin' 1, 2 , testin' 1, 2
Get a grip, bitch, come and get a whiff of this ol' slick shit
You think ya movin', but ya dreamin'
Nigga, ""Oaktown, Oaktown"" is what they screamin'
Uh, I'm doin' flicks, gettin' rich, fuck the Grammys
Hand on my jammy, word to granny
What goes on

So what really goes on
So what really goes on
So what really goes on

I gotta ask y'all a question:
What's the point of a nigga steppin' to the front
If ya plan is on 'fessing?
And I guess that some niggas don't know
Frontin' like a bitch have ya size double-cut low
I know a bro who stuck like Chuck in the middle of some shit
Always over grip
Scratchin' and make a nigga kill his momma
Pimp his son, step to his boy with a gun and a stun
Need to think that I could be a goner
Victim of an old school OC from the corner
I remember the days you used to meet me by the school
Playin' flies up
But, now, my niggas beggin' wit' a cup
So, when I got paid, I hit 'em off well
My old school G will lie for me or go to jail
But when it came time to show a true color
He was ghost and I was lyin' in the gutter
Ayo, now what's goin' on

So what really goes on
So what really goes on
So what really goes on
So what really goes on

The funk is on, all day and all night long, poppin' cops
'Til they drop, sideways to the next spot
Got my UZ hang, extra clip
In case some punk bitch wanna rip, he can get some of this
I duck and dodge longer than fifty niggas deeps in Jeeps
Smokin' marijuana, rather die than be dishonored
Bustin' left at the precinct and leach down low
Peelin' caps, so they know who's in control
I'm gonna see 'em on the door
Ra-ta-tat-ta-tat goes my TEC-9
Can't barely miss with dip, it's payin' back time
Harder for every jail than some police and these hypocrites
Equipped to kick a nigga's ass, hit the drop, move a hat quick
Shoot a cop for every blow, wish Rodney had a fo-fo
Smokin' cops like indo
So, then, maybe their friends know
Straight outta Oakland, pruck 'em, smoke 'em, make no tuck wit' 'em
Jackin' 'til the break of dawn
That's what really goes on

So what really goes on (what's goin' on)
So what really goes on
So what really goes on (what's goin' on)
So what really goes on
So what really goes on (what's goin' on)

This song go out to the Underground Railroad..
Digital Underground..

Resist the temptation of the beast
You slip and loose your grip, and forever fall asleep
The venom is contagious, be wary of its spell
What you thought would be heaven, turns out to be hell
I wonder if she knows, the devil's taking off her clothes
Deep into her soul, slow, now he's in control
Poppa's doing worse, a victim of his deadly curse
Wouldn't be the first, to leave the ghetto in a hearse
Oh and how it hurts, the children pay the biggest price
Never get the chance to grow up with a happy life
Blame it on the rock, but we know that's a bunch of crap
Someone from the top, supplying us with plenty crack
Keep 'em in a daze, don't let them see the other way
Let 'em all get paid, won't live to see another day
See, they never got a breath of the sunshine
Now the kid's addicted and only hit it one time
We're destined to be dead as a nation
Don't let it come to this, resist the temptation

From pyramid top to bottom of bowl
From whips and locks to fist and afro
We dug too deep to give up this gold
Don't be bought, and you won't be sold
Running on empty, you ain't gon' go
Running on empty, lead you to nowhere
We fact, nobody can lie
So resist the temptation

Gamble for your soul with the devil
You wonder how low, can you go, before you finally reach the lowest level
As everybody sit and stares
There's no use looking in your eyes cause there isn't anybody there
And though it may make you wanna cry
Got you stealing from your family and you don't even know why
I guess you think they'll understand
You feel cold, cause you sold your soul to the dopeman
Oh now there's no turning back, in fact
It's decided, that would live and die for the crack
You got no friends cause you cheated 'em all
Feel lonely, low, defeated and small
No one was there when I took the wrong path
And nobody'd care if I died in a blood bath
But is this my destiny?
Tell the lord they got my mind, but he can have the rest of me
Cause I'm ready to end it all
One bullet to the brain, forgive my sins and all
I didn't mean to be a bother
A failure as a son, a husband and a father
I wish I could turn back the time
Go back and find, why I let it crack my mind
And my only explanation, it came to this
Resist the temptation

From pyramid top to bottom of bowl
From whips and locks to fist and afro
We dug too deep to give up this gold
Don't be bought, and you won't be sold
Running on empty, you ain't gon' go
Running on empty, lead you to nowhere
We fact, nobody can lie
So resist the temptation

Your death left family behind
Your wife and your son find a gun, and pieces of daddy's mind
On the door and on the floor
Now her husband is dead, what else is she living for?
So now she picks up the gun
Now son is the only one
Grows up in adoption homes
Gets older, bolder, and cold cause he's left alone
To him, nothing is funny
Mind set on one thing, making his money
Since I was left with no hope
I want money and gold ropes and so I slang dope
Now I'm the neighborhood dopeman
And as long cause they smoking I'll never be broke man
I live the life of a trifle
Following a cycle, so I'm just a psycho
But if I had a better life
I would have lived a good life and did more things right
Hard to resist temptation
With all the aggravation and the frustration
Of living in the ghetto
Your mind gets twisted, just like a pretzel
So it's time that I check out
But one nosy cop, just won't let me get out
They got me trapped once again
With a choice: shoot the cop, or live life in the pen
I can't stand the frustration
Resist the temptation

From pyramid top to bottom of bowl
From whips and locks to fist and afro
We dug too deep to give up this gold
Don't be bought, and you won't be sold
Running on empty, you ain't gon' go
Running on empty, lead you to nowhere
We fact, nobody can lie
So resist the temptation

Rotten black cotton in God's eyes

Speak
(It's gonna get ya, gonna get ya)

Black Cotton
Steady stressing Smith & Wesson's count my blessings
Class is in session the worst question is the first question
Why do we work like slaves? sweating blades to an early grave
Never got paid but still we slave In the nine tre
Answer that then answer this too
Loves gonna get ya' you know it's true, life's a bitch true
You best to backtrack and try to act black and live
Not to be phoney and positive but why be negative?
What's the matter G? Black cat got your tongue
Fat track got you sprung now you're hung (Do ya feel me?)
Dum dum diddy answer me?
Attempt to reach, each and every brother on the streets
If not peace then, at least let’s get a piece
I’m tired of seeing bodies on the streets, deceased
Looking through my high school yearbook
Reminiscing of the tears as the years took
One homie, two homie, three homies, poof
We used to have troops but now there's no more, youth to shoot
God come save the misbegotten
Lost ghetto souls of black cotton (Cotton)

Black cotton
Rotten as the rest every day's a test I stress
Protection wear a vest is your best bet
Be on point make sure you're back it's got
Money hungry thinking 'bout the jackpot
Jewels and fat knot's get props
On the corner slanging marijuana wanna get, paid
Wasn't born with the silver spoon
(Never had it made)
That's why I act up you say I'm crazy lazy
But this is what you gave me don't have enough to feed my baby
If I decide to sell my soul, swallow my pride you can't
Hide from the truth the youth is dying inside
Lookout instead of putting a foot out
Shouting about the negative vibe's look in my eyes mad cause they on the prize
No need to wonder on the under try to stay low
I gotta make my mail slanging that just say no
Crack vial's stay in piles on my doorstep
The future scare's me you don't hear me
A double M is kept, ready to cock
Young black males to the top
Can't be stopped, straight from the school of hard knocks

If I could recollect before my hood days
I sit and reminisce, thinkin' of bliss and the good days
I stop and stare at the younger
My heart goes to 'em, they tested with stress that they under
And nowadays things change
Everyone's ashamed of the youth 'cause the truth look strange
And for me it's reversed
We left 'em a world that's cursed, and it hurts
‘Cause any day they'll push the button
And all good men like Malcolm X or Bobby Hutton died for nothin'

When you wipe your eyes, see it clearly

Maybe you can learn to cheer me

Livin' out of bag but she's glad for the little things she has
And over there, there's a lady, crack got her crazy
Guess who's givin' birth to a baby?
I don't trip or let it fade me
From out of the fryin' pan we jump into another form of slavery
Even now I get discouraged
Wonder, if they take it all back, will I still keep the courage?
I refuse to be a role model
I set goals, take control, drink out my own bottles
I make mistakes but learn from every one
And when it's said and done, I bet this brother be a better one
If I upset you, don't stress
Never forget that God isn't finished with me yet
I feel His hand on my brain
When I write rhymes I go blind and let the Lord do his thang
But am I less holy
'Cause I chose to puff a blunt and drink a beer with my homies?
Before we find world peace
We gotta find peace and end the war in the streets

Drinkin' Hennessey and cold brew
After smokin', stopped in Oakland
Got the munchies for some soul food
So we stopped to get a bite to eat
At the local barbecue
It's just another boring Monday
And there's nothing else to do
Now as we stepped out of the car
I heard someone behind me fighting
So I turn to look and find out
What's the cause of this excitement
One brother was a dopefiend
And the other was a dopeman
And the dope man had an AK
Said he'll spray and he's not jokin'
Well it seems to be the dopefiend
Owed the dope man for his product
And he swore if he did not pay
He would end up getting shot up
Now I could not walk away
Cause I got caught up in the scene
Wondering what would happen to this
Poor and helpless fiend
Well my homie, Michael Cooley
Said let's go and make our order
What's the use in watchin' two men
Stand out here fight over quarters
While I walked inside the diner
And all the Dope Fiends waved to me
Heard the sound of several gun shots
And I ran outside to see...
(What's goin' on)
Another gunshot rings
(What's goin' on)
Another siren screams
(What's goin' on)
Another mother cries
(What's goin' on)
'Cause another innocent dies
(What' goin' on)
All the people in the diner
Ran outside to see the big show
It was just another party
For them to see just who they would know
But for me I held concern
I wanted to go see the outcome
Would the mother have her son tonight
Or would she live her life without one?
I made it to the streets I
Almost cried right on the spot
Not only had the fiend died
But a small girl had been shot
And my heart could take no more
I felt a tear roll down my face
That was daddy's bullet
But she took it in his place
(What's goin' on)
Another gunshot rings
(What's goin' on)
Another siren screams
(What's goin' on)
Another mother cries
(What's goin' on)
'Cause another innocent dies
(What' goin' on)
I tried to make my way through the crowd
So I could go help the baby
She could barely speak
But she whispered
Mister can you please save me
So I screamed out, someone help me
But I dont think they could hear
And if they did, they didn't care
Oh how I hated everyone there
The baby lie here dying
And I wondered what could I do
The camera men and newspapers had come
To get their interviews
To them it's just a story
And they can't see the tragedy
To them it doesn't matter
Cause it ain't, it wasn't their family
I don't think I'll be back
Cause it'll never be the same here
So I wipe away the tears
And leave the scene the way I came here
Though some people say it's crazy
And the food could have been finer
I'll never forget, never forget the night
At Dopefiend's Diner
(What's goin' on)
Another gunshot rings
(What's goin' on)
Another siren screams
(What's goin' on)
Another mother cries
(What's goin' on)
'Cause another innocent dies

Running with leeches they sucking my energy
Fake in the mix, it just fuck up the chemistry
You ain't no homie, hoe you ain't no friend to me
Sonning you niggas but still ain't no kin to me
How can you say that you really not feeling me
I'm in the nosebleeds, I'm where the ceiling be
I'm in the clouds, Im just chillin at Jesus feet
Rapping like ""Lord they don't know I'm the trilogy""

I walked on water and these hoes still dont believe
I gave em bread, gave em fish from the spoiled sea
I healed the sick and

Broke outta my cages
Running in the woods on some runaway slave shit

Look far, look wide, I'm the best around
Nigga, got the game in my pocket
Plugged into my socket
Yeah, all eyes on me
Nigga, I'll ride around and 2Pac it

This drink is guaranteed to get the pussy wet and the dick hard
Now, if you with me, pour a glass and drink with a nigga
You know what I mean?
I ain't tryin' to turn you all niggas into alcohols... alcoholics
I'm just tryin' to turn you into motherfuckin' thugs
So come and get some of this thug passion, baby

Man, I could, pull like they dick would, be good until it's relevant
But I'm a straight soldier that I'll roll up a nigga like it's heaven sent
Trippin' over dead presidents, they got these derelicts
I thought was down with this business, tryin' to clown and get a cent
And so rather than stand forever, been thinkin'
Drinkin' over a felony and hell of me and how it will be in hella shit
People tellin' me to cool out, but they ain't feelin' me
A motherfuckin' fool 'bout my fuckin' cheddar cheese
And it pleases, passion of mine, thuggin'
Huggin' plenty of G's and laughin' while passin' through times
And all these backstabbers be watchin', just keep it plain
I'ma keep it the same partner, just take it the simple game
I can, pinkle with rain twinklin', diamonds and things go blinkin'
Enough to hold me 'til I'm old and wrinklin'
These adversaries, they gon' have to be worryin'
'Cause I'ma be illin', fulfillin' my passion

I heard it's the bomb

Give me some of your thug passion, baby, ohh

Now what if me turn this Hennessy into a robbery?
The prophecy probably suddenly switch how it supposed to be
And dirty money can't be evil 'cause it's fillin' up my tummy
Born in a position, death collision was futuristic
Twistin' riches, but there's only one way to make more
So I'm standin' on the corner tryin' to hustle in the snow
And my bigger bro, couldn't know
But buy a .44, blastin' at playa haters wantin' more
With a thug passion

Puttin' down, mashin', control by this thug's passion
Unlike them other bustas pistol blastin', I'm askin' what happened
To the niggas who kept it real like they claim to?
That's what money and fame do, see, they ain't true
Travelin' this road, my poor soul has been consolidated
With all this bullshit that I done tolerated
How I made it can be easily stated
It's like my hardest bring the grip with the passion
Left me to fuckin' greatest, load up and take shit

Make it to some high dollar gangsta shit
Jack a stack 'til we got enough bank to split

Creep with me, through that immortal flow (That's right)
Thug passion got you tremblin' like Death on the Row (Yeah)
Make your move, so I can throw your mind a curve
While I'll be blowin' up the scene, like my nigga Mr. Herb
Take a toke, as your heart goes full arrest
I got the bomb, so nigga, fuck the rest
You need a thug to get you flowin' and let that loc see smoke
Feelin' the strokes of the 9 squeeze tight and slow

I heard it's the bomb
And you got it goin' on
Give me some of your thug passion, baby
You got me drippin' wet
From the way you make me sweat
Give me some of your thug passion, baby, ohh

They say money don't make the man, but damn, I'm makin' money
Observin' you motherfuckers 'cause some of you bitches funny
Say you want it, but you bullshittin'
Lickin' them lips, you got me 'bout to act a fool quick
Sippin' on some Alizé and Cristal
Meanwhile, buy me a drink and get to winkin' at me
She smiles; a nigga's full of passion, satisfaction is everlastin'
""How does it feel?"" What I'm askin' while I'm rubbin' on that ass
""Why you laughin'?""See, I'm diggin' as if I'm curious
Full blown and furious, baby, get a grip, when I be doin' this
It's so physical, my attraction
Driven by alcohol, beware of my reaction
Baby, I'm born to ball, thugged out on Death Row
You better recognize and picture what I said so
Now you can feel it, it's a potion for my niggas in motion
Forever blastin', bitches ain't ready for this thug passion

I heard it's the bomb
And you got it goin' on
Give me some of your thug passion, baby

Yo, Eminem, show these mothafuckas what time it is, baby!

I used to be a lonely man, only mad
'Til I got a million dollars, shit, now if I only had
Some fuckin' hair I'd pull it faster than a bullet
Out of 2Pac's chest before the ambulance came too late to do it
I'm tryin' to grow it back again, it was an accident
I had my back against the fan and chopped it off in Amsterdam
I hate this straitjacket, it ain't latchin', and can't lock it
So they stapled my hand to my pants pockets
The cell's padded and battered like someone else had it
Before me and just kept throwin' their fuckin' self at it
My head is achin', I'm dedicated to medication
But this med is takin' too long to bring me this se-da-dation
Anyway, I got down with Dre
The first man who taught me how a Glock sounded to spray
Runnin' up and down the street, screamin', ""Fuck the police!""
When you still had your mother's fuckin' nipple stuck in your teeth
Became a role model after Colorado
Now all they do is follow me around and holler ""Bravo!!!""
Hell yeah, I punch my bitch
And beat my kids in public – suck my dick, bitch!
I'm sick enough to fuck a man in his face
But I won't, 'cause you probably wanna stand in his place
So put a sock in it, with your fake-ass 2Pac image
You faggots ain't tough, you just get drunk and become talkative
I'm probably the awkwardest alcoholic talkin'
Walkin' like a midget with a ladder in his back pocket
So when you see me on your block stumblin'
Mumblin' a bunch of dumb shit like my drunk uncle does
I ain't buzzed, I'm just high on life
So why on earth would I need drugs when I'm fly on kites?

Motherfucker! Slim Shady (Dr. Dre)
I'm drunk, pass the TEC!

'Cause if I get locked up tonight
Then I might not come home tonight
Keep it movin'! Off and on, Eminem is on
Off and on, Dr. Dre is on
'Cause if I get locked up tonight
Then I might not come home tonight
Keep it movin'! Off and on, Eminem is on
Off and on, Dr. Dre is on

The whole entire world can sit and twirl like a whirling tire
I set a fuckin' girl on fire with a curling iron
Psych! I'm just jokin', for Christ's sakes
Don't get so bent out of shape
'Cause I went out and raped six girlfriends
Some people just don't get it
But I won't let it upset me, 'cause they don't know better
They don't know what the fuck it's like to be so fed up
And fed so many uppers you're down and won't get up
My mind's got a mind of its own
Sometimes I can't find it at home
It hides in the stove (Hello, where you at?)
Shit, talk about your brain being baked
My shit's still in the oven on 480 degrees
Hailie Jade, Daddy loves you, baby
Don't ever tell me how to raise my daughter – fuck you, lady!
You critics wanna criticize but couldn't visualize
Individuals lives through a criminal's eyes
The neighborhood that I grew up in, you could die for nothin'
And Dirty Dozen watches over me so try some dumb shit
I'll have a fuckin' man raped with a Band-Aid
Over his mouth and shove his head in a fan blade
Don't ever tell me what I can and what I can't say
Or change 'cause of the age range in my fan base
Like I give a fuck who's buyin' this shit
Quit fuckin' buyin' it! I'm tired, bitch, I'm dyin' to quit
Hip-hop is universal now, it's all commercial now
It's like a circle full of circus clowns up in the circuit now
But now the white kids like it, so they tell me I can buy it
But as soon as I get on the mic it's like the night gets silent
Either that or booed, that's why I keep an attitude
And go to sleep with it and wake up with it every afternoon
I'm sick of being judged, fuck it, let me see a judge
I'll confess to every murder I committed since three years old

'Cause if I get locked up tonight
Then I might not come home tonight

Somewhere inside my childhood witnessed my heart die
And even though we both came from the same places
The money and the fame made us all change places
How could it be? Through the misery that came to pass
The hard times make a true friend afraid to ask
For currency, but you could run to me when you need
And I'll never leave, honestly
Someone to believe in, as you can see
It's a small thing to a true, what could I do?
Real homies help you get through
And come to knew he'd do the same thing if he could
‘Cause in the hood, true homies make you feel good
And half the times we be actin' up, call the cops
Bringin' a cease to the peace that was on my block
It never stops, when my mama ask me will I change
I tell her yeah, but it's clear I'll always be the same
Until the end of time

So take these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again
(Until the end of time)
So I can fly away, until the end of time
Until the end of time, until the end of time

Please, Lord, forgive me for my life of sin
My hard stare seem to scare all my sister's kids
So you know, I don't hang around the house much
This all-night money makin' got me outta touch
Shit, ain't flashed a smile in a long while
An unexpected birth worst of the ghetto childs
My attitude got me walkin' solo
Ride out alone in my lo-lo
Watchin' the whole world move in slow-mo
For quiet times, disappear, listen to the ocean
Smokin' Ports, think my thoughts, then it's back to coastin'
Who can I trust in this cold world?
My phony homie had a baby by my old girl
But I ain't trippin', I'm a player, I ain't sweatin' him
I sexed his sister, had her mumble like a Mexican
His next of kin, no remorse, it was meant to happen
Besides rappin', the only thing I did good was scrappin'
Until the end of time

So take these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again
(Until the end of time)
So I can fly away, until the end of time
Until the end of time, until the end of time

Now who's to say if I was right or wrong
To live my life as an outlaw all along?
Remain strong in this planet full of player haters
They conversate, but Death Row full of demonstrators
And in the end, drinkin' Hennessy
Made all my enemies envy me
So cold when I flow, eliminatin' easily
Falls to they knees, they plead for they right to breathe
While beggin' me to keep the peace (haha)
When I conceive closer to achieve
In times of danger, don't freeze, time to be a G
Follow my lead, I'll supply everything you need
An ounce of game and the training to make a G
Remember me as an outcast Outlaw
Another album out, that's what I'm about: more
Gettin' raw 'til the day I see my casket
Buried as a G while the whole world remembers me
Until the end of time

So take these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again
(Until the end of time)
So I can fly away, until the end of time
Until the end of time, until the end of time"

To all the happy people
All the happy people who have real nice lives
And have no idea what it's like to be broke as fuck

I feel like I'm walkin' a tight rope without a circus net
Poppin' Percocet, I'm a nervous wreck
I deserve respect but I work a sweat for this worthless check
I'm 'bout to burst this TEC at somebody to reverse this debt
Minimum wage got my adrenaline caged
Full of venom and rage, 'specially when I'm engaged
And my daughter's down to her last diaper, it's got my ass hyper
I pray that God answers, maybe I'll ask nicer
Watchin' ballers while they flossin' in they Pathfinders
These overnight stars becomin' autograph-signers
We all long to blow up and leave the past behind us
Along with the small fries and average half-pinters
But player-haters turnin' bitch like they have vaginas
'Cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us
Money'll brainwash you and leave yo' ass mindless
Them snakes slither in the grass, spineless

That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear

My life is full of empty promises and broken dreams
I'm hopin' things look up, but there ain't no job openings
I feel discouraged, hungry and malnourished
Livin' in this house with no furnace, unfurnished
And I'm sick of workin' dead-end jobs with lame pay
And I'm tired of bein' hired and fired the same day
But fuck it, if you know the rules to the game, play
'Cause when we die, we know we all goin' the same way
'Cause it's cool to be the player, but it sucks to be the fan
When all you need is bucks to be the man, plus a luxury sedan
Or comfortable and roomy in a 6
But they threw me in the mix with all these gloomy lunatics
Who walk around depressed, and smoke a pound of cess a day
And yesterday went by so quick, it seems like it was just today
My daughter wants to throw the ball, but I'm too stressed to play
Live half my life and throw the rest away

That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear

There's people that love me and people that hate me (Yup)
But it's the evil that made me
This backstabbin', deceitful and shady (Mhm)
I want the money, the women, the fortune and fame
That means I end up burnin' in Hell, scorchin' in flame
That means I'm stealin' your checkbook and forgin' your name
This lifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain
'Cause right now, I feel like I've just hit the rock bottom
I've got problems, now everybody on my block's got 'em (Duh)
I'm screamin' like them two cops when 2Pac shot 'em
Holdin' two Glocks, hope your doors got new locks on 'em
My daughter's feet ain't got no shoes or socks on 'em
And them rings you wearin' look like they got a few rocks on 'em
And while you flaunt 'em
I could be takin' 'em to shops to pawn 'em
I got a couple of rings and a brand-new watch, you want 'em?
'Cause I ain't never went gold off one song
I'm runnin' up on someone's lawn with guns drawn

That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear
That's rock bottom"

Leavin' them niggas head's blown

Talk a lot with your mouth, well, what you gon' do?
Shut 'em down, busters be knowin'

'Cause they fear when my squad face 'em
Take them to places, stake they face
Then erase 'em and brake 'em
Murder motherfuckers at a rate, and then quicken the pace
Blast me, but never ask me to live a lie
Am I wrong 'cause I wanna get it on 'til I die?
Now I'm worldwide; niggas gossip like girls, then hide
No offense to Nas, but this whole fuckin' world is mine
Even if you blind, you can still see my prophecy
My destiny to overthrow those on top of me

Started with five shots, niggas plottin' to kill him
Never figured that that same nigga sell five million
Hit the charts like a madman, nothin' but hits
Court cases got a nigga facin' multiple digits
Dodgin' cop cars, look at how we come so far
Picture a high school drop-out roll in a double R
House full of happiness, weed and drank
Way out, so when trouble tried to find me – can't
Never visioned livin' longer than my twenty first
Thought I'd be locked down, cracked out, or in the dirt
And though it hurts to see the change, it comes with the fame
Watch them gossip in this silly game
To all the motherfuckers speakin' down on me, this is the night

But we know all the same people so we got to speak
You taught me first: fake niggas can't stop a G
And all the shit you went through meant a lot to me
But when they locked you up for nothin', it was a shame to see
You know the crackers came, they did the same thang to me
I get along with real niggas, it's the lane to be
Talkin' loud out of pocket tryna bang with me
And so I pull it out my pocket, let it rain, you see
Now they all in the courtroom, blamin' me
See, we ain't live the same life but represent the same struggle
Power to the real niggas, death to the suckers
Money over bitches, get to know 'em for you love 'em
Death before dishonour, never talk to undercovers
Live by the same rules, so minus the tattoos
We the same sort of dude with the same short fuse

Movin' my tapes in major weight 'cause every dollar counts
Busters is jealous and half these niggas is punks
They runnin' off at the mouth 'til I fill it up with my pump
They jump, my automatic keep 'em weary
While you frontin' like you Billy Badass, nigga, you scary
I been knowin' you for years, we was high school peers
In Junior High I was itchin' to kill, and you was ready to die
While you bullshittin' niggas was dyin' and catchin' cases
Bustin' my automatics at motherfuckers in foreign places
Leavin' no trace, they see my face and they buried
Bitches die in a hurry, still I ride, I'm never worried
Mr. Makaveli tell me to ride, and I'ma ride
Pick my enemies out the crowd, and motherfuckers die

Untouchable mob of pistol packers
Well-known felons, labelled for drug-sellin' merciless jackers
Forever buzzed, roll with thugs and dogs

Outlaw and best believe they won't take me alive
I'm different and I'ma prove it if it take me to die
Knew that God had a plan for me
But he won't be layin' up in my casket or doin' life in the can for me
Maybe I'm breezy or paranoid than a bitch
Me dyin'—you think I'd let them see the joy from that shit?
Walkin' dead, angels spend they last days by me
New Jersey giant like Dave Tyree
Young George and Jonathan Jatt
Your guns clap, mine'll go brraaatt, soldier like Geronimo Pratt
And come through cockin' the black pound
When they put the Twin Towers up, Pac, I'm knockin' them back down
Poster child—cheque!
Air Force Ones with the crocodile checks, I'm supposed to wild sex
Money and murder is all I breathe in my life
It's full of judges and chasin' enemies in the night
Through the Henny I see the eyes of the Devil

I always thought I'd have to die to do a record with Pac
So I wrote from the perspective of a graveyard box
You end up in a box ‘cause them graverobbin' bastards
Dig your grave back up, snatch you out the casket
Worms in my eyes, eatin' through my cabbage
The flesh to the bones, the bones to the ashes
But I'm not dead, I'm actually in a session
With the Pac keepin' the shot money, progressive
They don't really want no drama, I know your goons
That's why I keep pressure on 'em like a open wound
This God-given, he keep givin' me better music
So every time you hear me my songs present improvement
Y'all can't kill me, y'all forever losin', songs are evolution
If I load your gun for you when we bang it out with some other niggas, you better shoot it
Don't try to lie and say you was bustin'—I'm clever, stupid!
Claimin' you reppin' Ruthless
You got the same bullets that you had when I loaded it for you, you never used it
The Nacirema dream get ready for execution
Papoose, Fatal and Pac—the revolution

Who you are
One nation under a thug and bullet scar

Separation is self destruction

Be sure to be bummy and be no longer there

Hard livin' got me goin' insane
But I'm addicted to the hustle I'm trapped in the game
What's next?
I'm goin' crazy
Tell me tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do?
What's next?
Hard livin' got me goin' insane
But I'm addicted to the hustle I'm trapped in the game

I'm goin' crazy
Tell me tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do?

That money gotta make it
What I gotta do to make it?
Do I really gotta take it?
Put this mack up to you, face it
Doin' what we gotta do to survive
Just ask Kweli, doin' what we do to get by
Some niggas stick to the crime
Pitchin' nickel and dimes
What the fuck we s'pose to do, who gon' give us a job?
So I tried and tried
Tried to get out the grind
But the block kept on callin' me back
Fiends kept on callin' for crack
So I supply 'em wit' that
Gave 'em a reasonable fee
Nigga don't blame it on me
Shit just look where I'm at
Niggas in gardens, LAPD is the target
Niggas is heartless, hustle regardless
Look that dope spot use to be an apartment
But now it's just a place to hide the guns in the closet
Watch ya step shift the grams under the carpet
We just tryin' hard not to see that coffin
What's next?

Hard livin' got me goin' insane
But I'm addicted to the hustle I'm trapped in the game
What's next?
I'm goin' crazy
Tell me tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do?
What's next?

Hands on my semi—automatic kill for pennies
Approach for contact, 'cause I'm live I multiply
Soon as I open fire, niggas die wit' open eyes
Scare to take a nap, it's a trap, a long maze
Dreamin' of gettin' stacks, makin' scratch the wrong way
What the song say, we murder motherfuckers daily
Black out blow the crack out, my lyrics never fail me
I inhale strong weed, then release the stress
Deliver the bomb shit from the east to west
Like yay-yo
Niggas pull out when I say so
Commence to poppin' motherfuckers copy me, it’s fatal
Efficiently I delete then flee
The art of war, livin' sucka free, get wit' me

The pedal to the metal, so I can't see what's behind me
Buckle up your seat belt eyes on the road
They know we ridin' dirty gotta play it how it go
They close down the projects the clubs been closed
And then they wonder why niggas breakin' down o's
I'm a run away slave
Ya get it nigga off the chain
I got that thug life shit runnin' through my veins
And now they scare, they know that I been heaven sent
And yeah we know the dope comin' from the president
But look at us, we ain't got shit to lose
Feel like we ballin' if we got a new pair of tennis shoes
In the ghetto or better yet home sweet home
This is the land of the free, but to me that's wrong
I'm on my way to the white house strapped wit' my heat

62 hours and countin', and I'm still awake
And they slippin' me sleepin' pills, wit' the will I break
Broke nigga always tellin' ya how to make ya cash adjust
So I just stop listenin' and now my cash is up
Red dotted the media 'cause they always mad at us
I don't see 'em tryin' to mediate, when we get gats and bust
They just instigate and as soon as the get the tape
It's dropped from my nigga life just as soon as they get the case
Personally I ain't trippin' on all this rappin' stuff
I'm takin' back my money counter 'cause it wasn't fast enough, yep
I got a couple problems (word) and none of 'em is money
Just those that love me to pretend to love me and say they buddies
Sometimes I want to maneuver with the Ruger
To live like Freddy Krueger these nightmares just ain't as bloody
In meetings they always askin' what my passion is
(And the) money talks so I always have words to answer this (yep)
I can't relax 'cause it's like I'm a fetti activist
Might see me on TV never a mat-tress

Hopped in the whip, popped the bottle, lit a blunt right now
Did about a buck-fifty, seconds later, the party right now

When I enter the first zone, worst known mic holder
My Hummer roll up, evacuating strapped soldiers
Inside strategy, manifestin' military styles
Casual tragedy when niggas battle me
My prophecized prediction, switch and move positions
Separated from his gun and bitch, and watch 'em start snitchin'
I keep spittin', still stupid niggas fail to listen
I personify this thug livin'; Hell or prison
My ammunition varies, my voice carries
Watch me invite the whole world me and the mob gettin' married
It seems horrifying screams pierce the dark
Just as suspected, a trick bitch where is your heart
You mark, watch niggas fall when I call they name
We outlaws hold your head niggas all the same
Except some who want more out of life than stress
We still thuggin' 'til it's no one left

Dumpin' on motherfuckers at random, rapidly
Wit' accuracy, they shouldn't talk, bad to me
It had to be a motherfuckin' murder, I'm glad to be
A nigga that did the murder, so sad to see
Another motherfucker floatin' In plastic reef
Sleep wit' his head wide open (head smokin')
Rapid release, keep the police coastin'
Casualties warrant in deep east Oakland (doors wide open)
Yolk the nigga off the asphalt
Drove off to the hills, positioned him on his knees and blew the back off
Death with the Lex Ruger, death to ya
Niggas cry when the bullets fly, kill and execute 'em

I blast first 'til they body me
Like my guns in variety
Runnin' wit' the real big willies you silly punks try to be
But front
Doin' my walk by's rollin' a blunt
Hands on my nuts in a getaway car full of stunts
Addicted to my nine, movin' like crime through time
Poppin' niggas like pimples nigga, nothin' simple 'bout mine
Etch-a-sketchin'
Dumpin' on all you punks at intersections

When I hit the street, all I can see is the grind
Blood sweat and tear, when I bust my rhyme
Yeah I un- for my folk like I load my nine
And when I let loose, then no crew standin' but mine
I gives a damn 'bout lame nigga actin' schiesty
Same one knew I was in jail and didn't write me
Wanna fight me then come find me
What ever you do shawty you better think wisely
You might see me wit' a stack in the trap (Aye)

Tryna pay my debt for all my sins
See, these penitentiary times be so heavy on my mind
At times it's like I'm livin' just to die
I'm livin' in hell, stuck in my jail cell
Stranded in the county jail, waitin' for my chance to post bail
I wanna be paid in large stacks and mash in fast Jags
I blast and wonder ""How long will I last?""
My memories fade when I'm intoxicated
Bustas are shady so I'm dumpin' on cowards crazy whenever faded
I know I said it all before, but now I mean it
Visions of me and you ballin', so crystal clear I seen it
Even though you mad at me, you'll be glad to see the strategy
Of makin' these chips come so easily
I max out in the morning, baby, life is good
Me and you against the whole hood – soon as I get home

Grab my straps, locate my comrades
Let's get my enemies not knowin' I'm comin' back
Soon as I get home
Go get the money out the safe
It's time to turn the streets into a war zone
Soon as I come home

Sittin' here lookin' at pictures of me and you livin'
But now you out in the world, while I'm twistin' in prison
Love letters come daily, words of affection
You send me money and nude pictures, beggin' for some sexin'
Stay wide open, keep your eyes peeled
And my advice is ""Keep it real or you can die squeelin'.""
Plus, I never had to worry 'bout a visit, ‘cause you're there daily
Guards tryna get your number, you don't dare tell me
Tongue-kissin', steady humpin', tryna touch up somethin'
Before the C-O in the corner jump in, frontin'
Late night reminiscin', everybody's quiet
I think something's in the air, prepare for the riot
It's padlocks in my socks, steel from the bed springs
I touch 'em with thug love and then let they heads ring
I started a war but now I'm gone
Release me to the streets in the mornin', it's on soon as I get home

Grab my gats, locate my comrades
Let's get my enemies not knowin' I'm comin' back
Let's get my money out the safe
It's time to turn the streets into a war zone
Soon as I get home

Since you've been gone
My whole life's been like a game of Cee-low
Thinkin' big, like the kid from Casino
Fulfillin' my dreams like Nino
Brown, the whole town be shook up
And me and Mama survivin'
Depends on how many rocks a young nigga cook up
Narcotics got traffic, seen those niggas you blasted
Wantin' me in a casket, on a ground, kind of plastic
Yeah, nigga, I heard, Lil' Mu gave the word
You get paroled on the third, it's all love with these herbs
We out here frontin', still here but all about nothin'
But double O's is what I'm wantin'
And I'm tryna see somethin' that we ain't never had
Luxury life, results livin' bad
Tricks of the trade, shit that shoulda been taught by Dad
But learned through the crew
Lessons between me and you
And once we lock this shit down it ain't a thing they can do
Meanwhile I stay waitin' by the phone
Hopin' I'll get a call tellin' a nigga that you home

Grab the gats, locate my comrades
Let's get my enemies not knowin' I'm comin' back
Go get my money out the safe
It's time to turn the streets into a war zone

Blind insanity, perfect pictures of me and my family
Not understanding the destiny, had they planned for me?
If I have kids, will I live to see them grow?
Though I don't know, I live the life of a thug nigga
Until the day I go, no broken promises

House full of happiness weed and drink
Way out sortin' trouble tryna find me king
Never pictured livin' longer than my twenty-first
Thought I'd be locked down, cracked out or in the dirt
And though it hurt's to see the change
It comes with the fame
Why we gossip in the silly games

We had no intentions of becoming homies
But at no time at all, you became my dog
You showed me how to roll blunts, we used to bounce and ball
I was living on Wilshire in the penthouse suites
Had my lil' cousin Daz hook you up with some beats
It was Outlaw, Dogg Pound, Death Row Records, man we tore up the town
Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre and now we got Pac, it felt like a drizzeam
Remember when I told Suge to put you on the tizzeam
And you know that I was true
Cause I took the focus off of me to put 'All Eyez On you'
And we became the most hunted together, '2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted'
And our relationship was genuwine

But we know all the same people so we got the speed
You taught me first -- fate nigga can't stop a G
And all that shit you went through meant alot to me
Watchin you lockin up with him, was a shame to see
You know crack in the business did the same thing to me
I get along with real niggas, it's a lane to be
Talkin' loud outta pocket tryna bang wit' me
Well so I'm pullin' out my pocket, let it rain ya' see
Now they all in the court room, blamin' me
See we lived the same life and represent the same struggle
Power to the real nigga and death to the sucker
Money over bitches get to know em' before you love em'
Death before dishonor never talk to army trouble
Live by the same rules, so my wrist's tattooed

Why yall niggas don't ever talk that shit when we be in the physical form?
Why yall niggas get all shy when we right there next to you at the premiere's and shit?
Hahaha
Yall niggas get alot of heart when you get in the studio, huh?
Get that can the man motherfucker wanna talk shit on the mic
Well do this for me, would you?
Next time you get the notion to talk some shit about an Outlaw nigga
Or a nigga from the west side the best side, call me
Call me nigga, reach out and touch a nigga, cause uh
If you don't do that and I hear one of you niggas sayin somethin on a record, ha
Expect me nigga like you expect Jesus to come back
Expect me nigga, I'm comin'
*Beat starts*

Ah, from the pressure, yeah
You know how we do this Quik, Outlaws, untouchable
After the fire comes the rain, after the pleasure there's pain
Even though we broke for the moment we'll be balling again
Time to make y'all, my military be prepared for the busters similar to
Bitches to scary, get to near me we rush 'em
Visions of over packed prisons, millions of niggas thug living
Pressure's, three strikes I hope they don't test us
So pull the heat out, ammunition in crates (shh)
Move without a sound as we slide down pistols in place
I'm sensing niggas is defenseless I'm hitting fences then getting ghost
Who can prevent me shooting senseless at these nigga's throats?
Only wish to breed, I explode into a million seeds
Y'all remember me legendary live eternally
Bury me in pieces cause they fear reincarnation
Niggas screamin' peace cause they fear when my squad face 'em
Take 'em to places face to face then erase 'em, and break 'em
Murder motherfuckers that are waitin' to quicken the pace

Bitch made niggas and that bullshit you going through
Outlaws busting while we rushing
We untouchable
Fuck you niggas and that bullshit you going through
We Outlawz rushing you busting you
We untouchable
(Repeat 2x)

Aiyyo we won't stop, I let the '44 pop
Tanqueray and Alize' make niggas get shot
I'm smokin on some kush baby, you know it's all Gravy
Calicos, AK's, nigga's yellin' mayday
Payday, soon as the red dots connect
Off that haze and that 'dro, that Cali sticky icky
Strictly 2-1-3, 8-1-8, 3-2-3
3-1-0, we Outlawz, baby

I'm surrounded by thugs, slugs with crystals and pistols, callin'
Copy murderers that be softer than tissues
Got my persona soldier dedicated to the fuckin drama
My foes retreat like pros when they post my pros
Mashin' like piranahs or a pack of pitts
Bodies get wasted, paper chasin', tryna stack a brick
Dear mama, I'm touched for lots of lethal clutch, clingin' for a life which ain't much
And a lust for these guns to bust
Ain't no trust for these herbs tryna wet ya, keep my burner on the dresser
Wake up bustin' in the mornin' from the pressure


I never had a chance to be a buster, I was raised hard
With the only shed of tattooed tears out near the graveyard
I rep my Outlaws deeply
Done seen too many real players fall to let the industry cheat me
Only behind the scenes do they see me as 2Pac the don
And this bitch with 2 Glocks, I'm wrong
The homie still gon' roll and standin' with your biggest G
You still gon' fold, I can guarantee you a lost
The homie 'Pac told me ""I can guarantee you a boss""
And it was in for a brief minute, far as my life
Since he disappeared, I still ain't found peace in it
But still strugglin like Mumia Abu, it was 'bout to end truly I knew
Named my daughter Assadah, for that alone, make 'em more than a rider
Got every homie trigger finger under the set
Dope but guaranteed now my 1 on 1 will connect


Fuck you niggas and that bullshit you going through
Outlawz! We untouchable!"

Seventeen years old kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time, I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school and scared to go home, I was a fool
With the big boys, breakin all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister
Over the years we was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddy's, the same drama
When things went wrong we'd blame mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary?
Hey! I see the penitentiary, one day
And runnin from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, mama
You always was a black queen, mama
I finally understand
For a woman it ain't easy tryin to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it
There's no way I can pay you back
But the plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

Dear mama
Don't you know I love you?
Dear mama
Place no one above you
(Dear mama)
Oh mama, I appreciate you
Although my shadow's gone
I will never leave you

Now ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love from my daddy cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry, cause my anger
Wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along
I was lookin for a father he was gone
I hung around with the Thugs, and even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin
I needed money of my own so I started slangin
I ain't guilty cause, even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin money in your mailbox
I love payin rent when the rent's due
I hope ya got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
Cause when I was low you was there for me
And never left me alone because you cared for me
And I could see you comin home after work late
You're in the kitchen tryin to fix us a hot plate
Ya just workin with the scraps you was given
And mama made miracles every Thanksgiving
But now the road got rough, you're alone
You're tryin to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

Dear mama
Don't you know I love you?
Dear mama
Place no one above you
(And dear mama)
Oh mama, I appreciate you
Although my shadow's gone
I will never leave you

Pour out some liquor and I reminisce, cause through the drama
I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate, how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle everyday, gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

Dear mama
Don't you know I love you?
Dear mama
Place no one above you
(Dear mama)
Oh mama, I appreciate you
Although my shadow's gone
I will never leave you

I appreciate you
I love you
I need you
Oh mama
I love you
Appreciate you
I need you

Oh, that nigga's body. I just wanna snatch his clothes off and just do him

So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars
This life as a rap star is nothin' without guard
Was born rough and rugged, addressin' the mass public
My attitude was ""fuck it,"" 'cause motherfuckers love it
To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
Uh-huh-huh, and my ambitions as a ridah
To catch her while she hot and horny, go up inside her
Then I spit some game in her ear, ""Go to the telly, ho!""
Equipped with money in a Benz 'cause, bitch, I'm barely broke
I'm smokin' bomb-ass weed, feelin' crucial
From player to player, the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
From hustlin' and prayers to breakin' motherfuckers to pay up
I got no time for these bitches, 'cause these hoes try to play us
I'm on a meal ticket mission, want a mil' so I'm wishin'
Competition got me ripped on that bullshit they stressin' (Booyah!)
I'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's mandatory
No guts, no glory, my nigga, bitch got the game distorted
Now it's on and it's on because I said so
Can't trust a bitch in the business so I got with Death Row
Now these money-hungry bitches gettin' suspicious
Started plottin' and plannin' on schemes to come and trick us
But thug niggas be on point and game tight (Yeah)
Me, Syke and Bogart wrap it up the same night
Got problems, then handle it, motherfuckers see me
These niggas is jealous
'Cause deep in the hearts they wanna be me
Nah, Now you got me right beside ya, hopin' you listen
I catch you payin' attention to my ambitions as a ridah

I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah

Lord, shed so many tears
C'mon, how we started nigga

Back in elementary, I thrived on misery
Left me alone, I grew up amongst a dyin' breed
Inside my mind couldn't find a place to rest
Until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest
Tell me, can you feel me? I'm not livin' in the past
You wanna last? Be the first to blast
Remember Kato, no longer with us, he's deceased
Call on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets
Now he rest in peace
Is there a heaven for a G? Remember me
So many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears

I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
Lord
And shed so many tears
Lord, I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears

Now that I'm strugglin' in this business, by any means
Label me greedy gettin' green, but seldom seen
And fuck the world 'cause I'm cursed
I'm havin' visions of leavin' here in a hearse
God, can you feel me?
Stop livin' in the past, you wanna last
Be first to blast, yeah, uh

Oh yes
See, it's the nigga named Nas
And he kick it with these niggas named Mobb Deep
And they kick it with some niggas named Bad Boy
I sent this out to Nas...

...and anybody else down with that clique
We still Bad Boy killas
Y'all don't feel us

Menacin' methods, label me a lethal weapon
Makin' niggas die witnessin' breathless imperfections
Can you picture my specific plan?
To be the man in this wicked land, underhanded hits are planned
These scams are plotted over grams and rocks
Outlawz motherfuckers die by the random shots
We all die in the end, so revenge we swore
I was all about my ends, fuck friends and foes
Me, a born leader, never leave the block without my heater
Got me a dog and named her ""my bitch nigga eater""
What could they do to me, you lil' brat?
Shit, them niggas that shot me is still terrified I'll get they ass
How can I show you how I feel inside?
We Outlawz, motherfuckers can't kill my pride
Niggas talk a lot of shit, but that's after I'm gone
‘Cause they fear me in the physical form
Let it be known I'm troublesome

Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na-na na, nahhh
Na, na, na, na
All you niggas die

Gutter ways, my mentality is ghetto
We guerrilla in this criminal war, we all rebels
Death before dishonor, bet I bomb on 'em first
Niggas knew we came for murder, pullin' up in a hearse
Westside was the war cry, bustin' off freely
Screamin', ""Fuck all y'all niggas!"" in Swahili
Pistol packin', fresh out of jail, I ain't goin' back
Release me to the care of my heartless strap
Say my name three times like Candyman
Bet I roll on yo' ass, like an avalanche
A sole survivor, learned to get high and pull drive-bys
Murder my foes, can't control my nine
Hearin' thoughts of my enemies pleadin', ""please""
Busta-ass motherfuckers tried to flee
Picture me lettin' this chump survive
Ran up on his ass, when I dumped he died
‘Cause I'm troublesome

Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na-na na, nahhh
Na, na, na, na
All you niggas die

""Murder, murder, my mind state,"" shit ain't changed
Since my last rhyme; the crime rate ain't decline
Niggas bustin' shots like they lost they mind
Like 25 to life never crossed they mind
Tell me young nigga never learned a thang
Dead at thirteen ‘cause he yearned to bang
Sent a lot of flowers, but how could I cry?
Need to stop the gang bangin', ""Either stop or die.""
Mercy is for the weak, when I speak I scream
Afraid to sleep, I'm havin' crazy dreams
Vivid pictures of my enemies, family times
Lord, forgive me ‘cause it's wrong, but I plan to die
Either take me in Heaven and understand I was a sheep
Did the best I could, raised in insanity
Or send me to Hell, ‘cause I ain't beggin' for my life
Ain't nothin' worse than this cursed-ass hopeless life
Nigga, we're troublesome

Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na-na na, nahhh
Na, na, na, na
All you niggas die

Welcome to the house the D-O double G built
We got honey, cream, silk and milk
We make that big bank and keep that big shank
Just in case we get slapped into the home we take
Nigga don't think Dogg slips at all
I make chips for crips and the beat dogs
True niggas, do niggas, hey you niggas
Can't get with us cuz we rip shit up
It's Mack Dime, and D-O dub
Here's a toast to the most, westcoast love
Fo sho though, I let you know from the get go
Pullin on my endo, rollin through the Wood with my kin dog

Not De La Soul, but fresh on parole
Now it's all about the hustle with the pebbles on swole
I'm know to the peoples as the Inglewood swanger
Been rollin gold Danas since a BG banger
It's a dog eat dog world in the city that I'm claimin
And niggas say we bangin cuz our colors be flamin
But I'd rather push crack, let the bank roll stack
I show Snoop how to whoop and then I front him a sack

Nigga better blue tennis shoes tidy, with our body
As I fall into the Mack 10 listenin party
Got greeted by some niggas who I never knew
Cold thing about it is that the niggas kept it true
Inglewood family is what they claim to bang
Street Rue and Maddog, I think that was his name
But anyway, what can I say?

No harm up in (?) so the hatas got bigger
But they figure platinum niggas keep a gold plated trigger
And that's fo sho though, you know how it go
Jump in the low low and bang with the homies, fuck a ho
So keep away crack and leave your bullet proof vest
Dogg there ain't no need for that, we headed west to the QS
Game recognize game, and it always should
It's all good and you niggas got a passion, Inglewood
Whoever trip get caught up in the middle like Monie
That's on the one and only I keep the big homies for the phonies
So let it be known, from my hood to your town
That connect game niggas is straight down with the Pound

Now all my peoples in the LBC pull up a chair and have a dime bag on me
See we be DPGin this, we in this thang to make hits and bump a
Bitch and maintain
Cuz the more better you get, the more cheddar you get
The more shit you talk, the more wet up you get
See, I found out quick, don't say shit
Just take care of yours, and handle it quick
Yeah, it don't stop for Biggie or 2Pac
Niggas been gettin shot on my block
But we got to make a change and the thang is this
I keep my heater by my seater just in case y'all twist
But I wish upon a star
To stay down with Mack Dime, pushin caviar
The real recognize the real, I'll kill for that nigga
ING DPG, deal with it nigga, for real
 X 2

They live on the streets, and they hustle for fame
Some claim twenty crip but most claim insane
See it's not a lifestyle, it's a full time job
And if you live in Long Beach, it's like a macabre
]From blunt to blunt, everybody's bad
And if you don't know where you at you better tuck in your rag
Push heat on the street, with Chuck D's on his feet
Makin money slangin tapes up out the Compton swap meet

Up jumps the boogie some niggas gang bang
So keep a big steel if it's a real G Thang
But I kick back, relax, count hundreds by the stacks
And keep the yay on the stove till the whole key cracks
Ain't a busta in the crew, so I'm callin all hogs
It's connect gang rollin with the Pound and Snoop Dogg
And everythang all gravy like it's 'posed to be
It's Long Beach with the Ingle dub O-O-D city

Uh, I swear I'll never call you bitch again
Believe that
This that new shit I wrote for the true sisters
They said I kept saying ""bitch"" too much
So I got this new shit for y’all
I swear I never call you bitch again

They gave my homie 90 days for domestic violence
I try to picture myself in this position but remain silent
I get to thinkin' 'bout this shit we been through
We close like kin, but you remain my friend too
This life of sin done got the both of us in trouble
But you always stay down for a nigga, so that’s why I love you
Reminiscin' needin' tissues, fightin' over childish issues
Swear I can't live with you; but without you, every day I miss you
When we roll you hold my pistol, my gangsta bitch-itch, you
Always in the mood for love, that's why I'm sleepin' with you
Though not the man of your dreams
My plan and scheme’s to be rich like a king
And live my life trouble free, I see
Yesterday I called you names and played games on your mind
I promise that I’ll change in time
It's a complicated world, so girl, just be a friend
I swear I’ll never call you bitch again, believe me

Uh, never, Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
I swear I'll never call you bitch again, believe me

I wake up early in the mornin', at the crack of dawn
Nigga still tired so I'm yawnin’, and now I'm gone
Tryin' to get my money on strong, so an early riser
Out before them other guys, that's the way to profit every time
Can't be too close my enemies, they see ghosts, they envy me
Plus we been beefin' with the East Coast, with casualties
Got stopped in traffic, had a warrant, so they gaffled me
But while I'm gone, watch my business and my back for me
My enemies think they got me goin', they ain't knowin'
Ain't no love for player haters where you cowards goin'
You paid bail, got me out of jail, home again
I promise not to leave you on your own again
Cristal corks are popped, romantic thoughts are dropped
It's so frantic but don't panic, ‘cause we crossed the top
Told you young lady ""you a woman and friend""
I swear I'll never call you bitch again, believe me

Uh, uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
I swear I'll never call you bitch again, believe me

You wanna test me, let's see if you'll survive .45 times
Like a hollow-point headed for your dome
Take a couple of steps, turn around, and it's on
Couldn't withstand the murderous mental
I subdue, and then take two to your temple
When I come to the rhymes that I'm speakin'
Niggas collapsing when the straps is spittin'
Look, this is how it's done, nigga
One two three, I grab my strap, you best run, nigga
I gives a fuck, Kurupt's the kingpin of the click
Littlest G, with the biggest dick, what

Somebody better recognize
With a twist of my wrist like O.J. you all die
I snack on motherfuckers like a bone
Known to be the shit upon the microphone
Ever since I was born, not to ever love a bitch
Learned game after game, that's why we are the best
Motherfuckers be gankin' styles minute after minute

Bitches butterfly all day, while I steady make my pay
Every single day in the LBC (East side)
Cruisin' through the Eastside, me and Lil' Style
In the back of a green 6-4 bustin' freestyles

There's no escape, give me the papes and the tape case
How much money can a nigga make in one place?
The review, ain't shit new
You stupid motherfuckers can't fuck with my crew

I see all these niggas tryin' to get with my kin folk
Get so many busters on the West Coast
And then, to say the least
I see a few trick-ass niggas layin' low on the East Coast
And the question is asked: Do you wanna rap, scrap, or blast?
'Cause Dat Nigga Daz'll be the first one to hit him
Oh yeah, fuck B.G. Knocc Out and every nigga down wit' him
'Cause I'm a natural born killer
In a Steeler hat, motherfucker, 'cause it's like that

Now what would you do
If you could fuck with me or my crew?

There's so many motherfuckers that I can include
Who's quick to blast motherfuckers in a feud?
It doesn't make a difference
'Cause it's about who's the quickest
On the draw to end all existence
For instance, let's take these Ruthless fools
These Ruthless fools and the Pound in one room
Assume, it's only for conversation
So let's conversate, slip a nigga the .38, then dip
Empty out the clip
Mind on set-trip, 'cause niggas talk shit

Now if a nigga had a prayer before a nigga died
Would the nigga be dead or would he stay alive?
And if I was in your own shoes, would I survive?
Probably not, you'd probably let your Glock go pop
Now drop to your knees
And picture raw ass gangsas flowin' in the breeze

Now what would you do
If you could fuck with me or my crew?
But you can't, so don't even think about
Steppin' in the motherfuckin' house
Now what would you do

Pumping on my chest and I'm screaming
I stop breathing, damn I see demons
Dear God, I wonder can you save me
(I can't die my boo boo's bout to have my baby)
I think it's too late for praying, hold up
A voice spoke to me and it slowly started saying
(Bring your lifestyle to me, I'll make it better)
But how long will I live? (Eternal life and forever)
And will I be the G that I was?

For me to walk again and talk again but anyway
I get fronted some keys to get back on my feet
And everything that nigga said came to reality
I'm living like a baller loc
Having money and blowing hella chronic smoke
I bought my Momma a Benz (And bought my boo boo a Jag)
And now I'm rolling in a nine-trizzay El Do-Rag

Cause when you start set-tripping, that ass is mine, nigga)

Them niggas from the other side recognize my face
Cause it's the O.G. D-O-double-G, L-B-C
I'm mad dogging niggas cause I don't care
Red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair
Niggas stare as I enter the center
They send me to a level three yard, that's where I stay
Late night I hear toothbrushes scraping on the floor
Niggas getting they shanks, just in case the war, pops off
Cause you can't tell what's next
My little homie Baby Boo took a pencil in his neck
And he probably won't make it to see twenty-two

Verse 1 (Kane)
Six in the morning and I see the sunrise
Wish I died in my sleep didn't want to open my eyes
To see this world so fucked up for me
And my family, worked so hard but can earn a decent salary
These bills keep whooping a nigga ass
Spent my whole check trying to dress with class
I found myself having to smoke weed just to chill
Both my parents got killed and I ain't cried still
All my niggas getting shot, peoples mama's smoking rock
And who the hell can stop these fucked up cops
They like to overseaers and we like the slave bitches
Offer pussy to a nigga even though they got AIDS
You jumping in that pussy thatn you diving in the grave
White man build the prison and the niggas come through
Like the motherfuckers giving out free barbeque
Lock a nigga up for life and say fuck you
Most of ya'll ain't make it pass the 12th grade
That's why you making minimum wage or slanging rocks for chump change
Alot of people died for the right to vote
We don't use white devils taking nigga land and missuse it
On top of that I think my uncle on crack
My boy Quay Shaun took a slug in his back
]From another black now he in the coma trying to make it back
Come on come on
My old lady think she pregnant I ain't got no cash for her
She probably fucking another nigga I wouldn't put it past her
My mind got me murderous like John Doe
Bitch ass niggas trying to play me like a hoe
And now I'm rolling round sucking on a steel dick
Bout to pull the trigger end it cause I'm tired of this bullshit
Know what I'm saying grown men don't cry
But the ghetto got me wheeping like a bitch I'm gone die on my knees
(Chorus)
Black Jesus tell me why this world so fucked up
Allah, tell me why this world so fucked up
Black Jesus tell me why this world so fucked up for me
For me a nigga
Verse 2 (Abel)
They say that I was dealt some bad cards in this game of life
But before I take my trip I'm gone leave with them stripes
Sending dime bags of weed, toting nines til nose bleeds
My nerve so bad I had to pop one of those b's
I had to strap my jimmy hat or catch this double mint disease
See the devil in a crack pipe pointing at me
I seen a nigga shaking just lke he caught the holy ghost
But he really scored a gram of heroin for 80 bones
I got them stones, if you take a hit you can't resist
Now I'm crying, I think one of my brothers on that shit
Do you care if you live or die, really I don't know
But if there's hell below I think we all gonna go
(Chorus)
Verse 3 (Master P)
Tell me is this heaven, is this hell
I ain't LL, but all I hear is funeral bells
The ghetto's trying to kill me, a born loser
A born hustler my uncle's a drug user
I'm from the projects or should I say the 3rd Ward
Where fools into killing and fiends walk like androids
Hooked up with the twins or should I say Kane & Abel
Trying to keep some change in my pockets, some food on my table
Verse 4 (Silkk)
You know what P your right
Cause Silkk was on the block like last night
Niggas doing anything from selling drugs
To sell mugs smoking that glass pipe
I'm from a messed up city where niggas don't live long
They parents out-live they kids
Rest in peace to my homie they like split his wig
Now who won't walk that last mile to they death
Imaging taking a deep (inhales) that was your last breath
Just imaging your mom was prostituting your mom was smoking
Imagine your eyes don't close imagine your eyes don't open
I be like trying to keep the world and stay TRU
There's too much drama in my hood, gotta stay cool
Verse 5 (Master P)
As I lay me down to sleep
Black Jesus if you real, take me out this ghetto g
Cause its crazy its wicked
I got niggas on every block trying to get a meal, ticket
They killing they murder
Little kids in 3 inch girdles
And life is just like Pac Man
Niggas gumping up niggas but who gone be the next man
To lose his shoes, I mean lose his life
Who gone think twice, dying in this ghetto life
Cause in the White House, politicians run the country
But where I'm from in the ghetto's its bout drug money
Ice cream slanging
Niggas banging red and blue everybody's hanging
Niggas bout it, little kids get rowdy
But will I make it out this ghetto, I doubt it
(Kane & Abel talking)
I think the devil trying to get me to sell my soul
He keep on walking with me, he keep on talking with me
I think the devil's trying to get me to sell my soul
He trying to temp me with the bitches and money
Black Jesus black jesus if you feel me
Than save me and my ghetto people"

New York, New York, big city of dreams
And everything in New York ain't always what it seems
You might get fooled if you come from out of town
But I'm down by law, and I'm from the Dogg Pound

It's the incredible, the lyrical
You can't be me like Niece, to see me is gonna take a miracle
I'm driving motherfuckers hysterical, with a
Touch of this twister, stylistic mixture
What I create pulsates, there is no escape
Annihilate your mental mindstate (Motherfucker)
Dre labels my vocabulary abusive
I packs more knowledge than Confucius, I'm deadly
Induce you like Medusa, with thoughts to shed
And niggas throughout this hemisphere, far and near
Prepare, catch me chillin' like the winter
Up against the number one contender, as I enter
Cause I gets heated like friction
Motherfuck your whole jurisdiction, react this fact not fiction
Telepathic addiction, to this homicidal recital
Dangerous and vital to all my rivals
Suicidal, brainwaves conveys
To the average motherfucker's minds these days
I'm all ready to put work in
Take ten steps and turn to shoot the first nigga smirkin
I don't give a fuck, what's your name, what you claim
Or why you came, motherfucker don't explain
Simply, don't tempt me, cause I'm simply
Layin hoes lifes empty, the invicible MC

New York, New York, big city of dreams
And everything in New York ain't always what it seems

Gimme a couple G's, for every MC, I knocked to his knees
Verbally useless, oh you got the juice? I squeeze you juiceless
The barbaric, versatile, you're no kin to me
So how the fuck you inherit my style?
Now, out the clear blue sky, I can't deny
Not a day goes by, don't get high, don't ask why
Tonight's the night for me to rip microphones
Into bits and pieces lyrical telekinesis
Gets me into verbally vindictive
Violent vocabulary bobs to existence
Catch me in the pitch black path
I sit and let the sick thought pass through my mental
Till I hear an instrumental
And detrimental verbals get to spittin'
The highest in intellect, try connectin' with the written
Now they faced with the forbidden, vocally chosen
To explore new terrain, then remain unseen, throughout the war
Dips like a low-low, with my verbal fo'-fo'
The cocoa complexion MC with the slow flow
Fo sho', I takes it to you from the do'
Motherfucker, mentally I go hardco' (you know!)
I disconnect ya, Kurupter, MC to vocally
Bore your whole molecular, structure
Catastrophic, mystic as Mixelplix
Hittin' MC's like picks the deadliest lyricist

Woke up one morning out some bomb ass cock
My dick kinda limp so I cruise around the block
Call my cousin Snoop as I swoop in the Coupe
Stop by my homey Dru house to puff on the loop
Seen my little homey Style who I ain't seen in a while
Damn near gone, floatin' on cloud one-nine
Liquor store, so I grab some mixed gin and juice
Got a quarter pound of bud so I'm fucked up too
Seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve
Bailed back in the crib (For what?) Because I'm all-in
Conversated then I dug that hoe out
I fixed me some food, then boned the hell out, and said
Tomorrow, tomorrow, check it out
Here we go and we'll be back to dick you out
G's up, hoes down
If she can't swim, she's bound to drown
Two A.M. on the dizot, I pause and I stizop
I reminisce on that ass that I rizzocked
Now I'm high as a kite
Yeahh, and I'm feelin' alright
Four A.M. as I stoll back to my crib
To see what's with my woman and my newborn kid
With my mind on my money and my money on my mind
We do this everyday about the same time, beyotch!

I was at the park one day, that's when I saw her face
She looked kind of cavi to me
(Don't stop, c'mon)
But when I take her home, and tap that ass I'm gone
I'm just a dog, don't blame me
Yeah

Now do I love them hoes? (Hell nah!)
And why is that? (Because you're Snoop Doggy Dogg
And you never gave a fuck about a bitch
'Cause to you, bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks)
Ha ha, dee dee dadi dadi dah
Listen to the sounds from my nigga Doggy Dogg
Slidin' through the city in the rag six-fo'
Hoppin' like a motherfucker tryin' to find a hoe
Hittin' all the spots but I'm comin' up blank
I'm headed to the liquor store to get myself some drank
Parks my ride as I, steps inside, as I
Puts my nine double-M to my side, as I
Continue with my mission
Pussy is my dish and I'm fishin', wishin'
Upon a star, to come up on some ends
Pushin' caviar, and a little bit of pussy
So I can get my pimp on
'Cause my pen gets my pimp on from G to ozone

Let's make a move for this paper (Where we rollin' Dogg?)

I mean I steps to tha stage in my G-boy stance
And say a few rhymes to make your girl wanna dance
I'm so fly like a dove
I come from up above
You trippin' on your girl cause she showed me love
Nigga don't beat em, cause if you beat 'em, you don't need 'em
You lay your hands on me, watch how fast I take your freedom
I delete em, but don't mistreat 'em
I stay up on em, and that's one ta grow on
Let me flow on
You can rock to the rhythm you see
Or you can rock to the rhythm of me
Just remember when you do your thang
Make sure you do your thang on a hang
And everything, is everything

Am I trippin' ya'll? (Hell nah!)
Now, when I grow up, I wanna be like Snoop
Have prestigious women
That's the truth from the beginning
In and out of the flyest hotels
You say your family don't know me
Hold on homie, that's for most and promos
Sales, tails, scales and jails
Success before death
No one in my clique fails
As females with the almighty Father lead
Succeedin' ta give my peep's just what they need
And it ain't no party like this kind
Cause you can leave your worries behizzind
But I'mma git back to the grizzind
Snoop D-O double G comin' back for mizzine and
I'm tha DoggFather

Snoop Doggy Dogg is Doggy..."

Uh, picture-perfect, I paint a perfect picture
Bomb the suckas with precision, my intention's to get richer
With the S-N double-O-P, Dogg, my fuckin’ homie
Did this cold, how we fade our foes

Sure 'nough, I keep my hand on my gun
'Cause they got me on the run
Now I'm back in the courtroom, waitin' on the outcome
""Free 2Pac"" is all that's on a nigga's mind
But at the same time, it seems they tryin' to take mine
So I’ma get smart and get defensive and shit
And put together a Million March for some gangsta shit

So now they got us laced
Two multi-millionaire motherfuckers catchin’ cases
Bitches get ready for the throwdown, the shit's about to go down
Me and Snoop about to clown
I’m losin' my religion, I'm vicious on these stool pigeons
You might be deep in this game, but you got the rules missin'
Niggas be actin’ like they savage, I'm out to get the cabbage
I've got nothin' but love for my niggas livin' savage

I've got a pit named Petey, she Nigerina
I've got a house out in the hills right next to Chino
And I think I've got a black Bimmer
But my dream is to own a fly casino
Like Bugsy Siegel, and do it all legal
And get scooped up by the little homie in the Regal
It feels good to you, baby-bubba
You see, this is for the G's and the keys, motherfucker

Now follow as we ride
Motherfuck the rest, two of the best from the Westside
And I can make you famous
Niggas been dyin' for years, so how could they blame us?
I live in fear of a felony
I never stop bailin' these West Coast G's
If you got it, better flaunt it
Another warrant, two of America's most wanted

Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party, party
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party, party

It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party)

Give me fifty feet
Defeat is not my destiny, release me to the streets
And keep whatever's left of me
Jealousy is envious, sufferin' is greed
Better be prepared when you cowards fuck with me
I bust and flee, these niggas must be crazy, what?
There ain't no mercy motherfuckers who can't fade the thugs
You thought it was, but it wasn't, now disappear
Bow down in the presence of a boss player

It's like Cuzz, Blood gang-bangin'
Everybody in the party doin' dope-slangin'
You gotta have papers in this world
You might get your first snatch before your eyes swirl
You doin' your job every day
And then you work so hard 'til your hair turns gray
Let me tell you 'bout life and 'bout the way it is
They say we live by the strap, we die by the strap, kids

They tell me not to roll with my Glock
So now I got a throw-away
Floatin' in the black Benz, tryin' to do a show a day
They wonder how I live with five shots
Niggas is hard to kill on my block
Schemes for currency and dough-related
Affiliated with the hustlers, so we made it
No answers to questions, I'm tryin' to get up on it
My nigga Dogg with me, eternally the most wanted

Now do the gangsters run this motherfucker? (Hell Yeah)

But in the lobby, Shakur was shot several times, including two graze wounds to the head. 2Pac's lawyers said the attack appeared to be a setup

Against doctors orders, 2Pac Shakur checked himself out of the hospital less than 24 hours after being shot 5 times on the way into a Manhattan recording studio

2Pac Shakur secures one clean legal victory this year, as he's dismissed of assault charges brought against him when he allegedly shot at two off-duty Atlantic cops on Halloween last year. The case was dismissed due to insufficient evidence

More controvery surrounding 2Pac Shakur ...

Meanwhile, in 2Pac news, at about 6:45 tonight, Shakur may have lowered his own chances of surviving the attack by checking himself out of the hospital that probably saved his life

2Pac Shakur checked into the Metropolitan Hospital yesterday under an assumed name. His lawyers said that he had connections, but wouldn't say what kind, that could provide top notch security for the injured rap star

Shakur underwent surgery today ...

The shooting of 2Pac Shakur here in New York City once again underscores the violence that has surrounded this man since he shot to superstardom in the world of music and entertainment"

Let me take a minute to re-check myself
I been going through a lot and I been praying for some help

I here my people talking about the things that need to change
For this new generation but nobody's taking action
We can't keep fighting and forever struggling
But you were the one, you left the to's
And now it's time for us to, to bring a new

Turn me up, turn me up, turn me up, what
Turn me up, turn me up, turn me up, what (yeah)
Turn me up, turn me up, turn me up, what (yeah, what, yeah, uh)

Pack your cannons we outlandishly brandish the weapons
Meet Jamaican like you god {U-god?} and 'em handing you lessons
We learn a lot from the 60's like glaring 13 necks
Mainly the niggas get shot for flaring out their larynx
And get to speakin' on a conditions of black people
That's illegal they enforce it with the force that's lethal
Make you wanna grab a gun and throw the all black gear on
Head to congress exercising your constitutional right to bear arms
Leather jackets and glasses and you can tell it's us
The FBI probably bust a nut if we self destruct
Call it militant but ain't nobody killing Barry {Goldwater}
You can't be militant if you ain't got no military
But it's still a very powerful word
Picture some niggas with guns, got 'em very disturbed, word
Now-a-days you could get shot for a cheap necklace
Back then my people bust shots for the free breakfast

Now before you see God, or stand before Allah
You could learn from the stars that fall outta the sky
Everybody act hard, like they got no regard
So we mourn falling stars, they still living all hard
(We still here, word)

This is for Medgar Evers, Martin, and my brother Malcom
Sometimes we be sittin and wishing for another outcome
My head be spinning, it be full of why's and the how come's
The value of life is so cheap if your skin ain't talcum
We need leaders, we looking at entertainers
It's about the cash, so we respect the biggest gainers
Niggas get paid then they run away from the community
That ain't gangsta nigga, you the opposite of Huey P
Don't be confusing me with haters, player
Get your paper, just show respect to the folks who made you (yeah)
Blessed by the creator so give money nigga
Just don't bring a plate of food around a hungry nigga
Out on these streets the police is killing
I'm spilling out my heart on these beats so I can feed my children (yeah)
Disrespect and I'm a give you a bar to save your life
Because we don't need no more fallen stars

Now before you see God, or stand before Allah
You could learn from the stars that fall outta the sky
Everybody act hard, like they got no regard
So we mourn falling stars, they still living all hard (We still here)

Stalk the stage with the pride of the panther
Hands off Asada and the blood of a dance floor
Word, rock on, throw the 2Pac on
He's not gone, you hear his influence in pop songs
Shine brighter than those Vegas lights
Illuminating that Vegas night to the party after the fight
'til the gunshots disturb the peace like Luda
Too bad he ain't a white chick in Aruba
They'd have a whole department dedicated to finding the killer
You'd see Afeni Shakur on Larry King, and motherfucking Dennis Miller
Word, Bill O'Reilly would be flapping his gums
How much respect do they have for my people?
Actually none
You either do the nigga packing a gun who hate niggas
Even though every time he pass a mirror he staring at one
My man stressed cause of lack of funds
This the type of shit that make you wanna drown your liver
And blacken your lungs

Now before you see God, or stand before Allah
You could learn from the stars that fall outta the sky
Everybody act hard, like they got no regard
So we mourn falling stars, they still living all hard (We still here)
Now before you see God, or stand before Allah
You could learn from the stars that fall outta the sky
Everybody act hard, like they got no regard
So we mourn falling stars, they still living all hard (We still here)

Now of course this was inspired by 2Pac Shakur
Eazy-E, still here (still here)
My man Justo (still here)
Big L (still here)
Big Pun (still here)
I'm from Brooklyn, you know what I'm saying
Brooklyn know a lot about tragedy
We lost our Big Poppa and our baby girl
That was our whole world, yo (still here)
This is for our fallen stars
Inspired by the poets, revolutionaries, and activists
From the generation before us
Come and do our thing on this microphone
When else in the history of this country
Can a black man get on the microphone
And say whatever the hell he wanna say?
It's a lot of responsibility
But we standing on the shoulders of our ancestors
So I bear that burden, throw it on my back"

Yes, sir
This is Ludacris
In a recite to you an original poem written by my man 2Pac Shakur
Entitled; in the depths of solitude
And it goes with a something like this
Eh, ehhm
Yeah
I exsist in the depths of solitude
Ponderin my true goal
Tryin to find piece of mine
And still preserve my soul
Constantly learnin to be accepted
And from all recieve respect
Never compromising but sometimes risky
And that is my only regret
How can there be peace
A young heart with an old soul
How can I be in the depths of solitude
When there are to inside of me
This duo within me causes the perfect oppotunity
To learn and live twice as fast
As those who accepts simplicity
Yes
If you're reading between the lines you can understand exactly what my man
2Pac shakur was talking about mayne
You see in or outside the music industry
Everyone has heard the expression as lonely on top
Well you know
Pac was on top
It's only naturally that he exsisted
In the depths of solitude
Of course he was a young heart with an old soul
And individual with, what was a way ahead of his time
And sometimes when you are ahead of youre time
You do wonder what your true goal in life is
When you get so ovius critisising and put down for teaching
What you've learned to others
And doing what you feel is the rigth thing to do
So with that
Pac like all soldiers fought, to be accepted
Specially by those who rejected him the most
And even if you didn't like him
You had to respect him
See nobodys perfect
And off course everyone makes mistakes
But experience is the best teaching, if you ask me
So its important to learn from each mistake
And try hard, not to make the same one twice
His only regret was making the mistake of being too overdemanding at times
But it was the wild outrages Pac
Mixed with the sensitive love in Pac
That made him almost the perfect person
Also made him learn and live twice as fast
And I'm sure, he would rather walk through life
With these multived dimensional personalities
Than to except being one side than simplistic
Any day..
So being in the depths of solitude, if you ask me
Is were the true heroes of our times stay
2Pac Shakur, in our hearts and our minds forever
Rest In Peace, live in harmony...
This is Luda, signing out
Peace"

I hope I at least died for a principle, or a belief I've lived fo'
And if I die before my time, when I'm not fast enough to catch my breath, oh no
Give my apologies to the man upstairs, let him know I tried my best

And as I'm movin on
No I've come to grips with this old sayin goodbye thing
And though my body's gone
Rest assured that my kids will know that daddy's never far from home
I'll be seein you
On the other side of that yellow brick road, we've been told so much about
No doubt, no doubt
I'm gonna miss y'all, miss y'all, miss y'all

Before I reach my death y'all there's still some things I wanna see

Yo, it's just another day I wake up, it's more rock to break up
We take physical losses and y'all just take a pay cut
Plus, you take a mortgage loan to hold ya home
But our credit is pathetic they just let it be known
So they evict us, got some of my sisters livin' in shelters
It's the system, the difference you teach ya kids to know better
But you can go home, you know ya mom and pop there
Yeah, we can go home but our life is out there
Yeah, bills through the roof I'm makin' payments every week
Get my money off them books cuz ain't nobody hired me
People die in your community, life is a struggle
Kids dyin' every day cuz they be shootin' for the coke
Life through my blood shot eyes can be trouble sometimes
I smoke the pain away but still not high
I sip that Henny, say a prayer, after that then I'm good
Just bless the days for all my people that's raised in the hood

I been through numerous hoods, they livin' just like we
I've seen the wars, seen the struggle, seen the violence in the street
Seen a hustler get fed up sometimes and pop back at police
Cuz he couldn' stand to see himself in penitentiary
Couldn't see those type of numbers so it's elementary
See the way I see it's gotta be Heaven for a G
Cuz it's hell tryin' to feed ya seed and leave a legacy
See wrong, see right depends on how you see in life
See justice, she's blind she won't let you see the light
Seen people doin' bad I ain't the only one that see
Seems like they wanna see us all in this poverty
See, I'm in the hood they buildin' condos every week
Shit, it hurts to live like this see it's nice across the street
But if you can focus in this life ain't ride
If you can vision what I printed you'll see life through my eyes

It causes your soul 2 freeze
Spreads throughout your spirit
Like a ruthless feeling disease
The walls that once were down
Now stand firm and tall
Safe from hate/love, pain/joy
Until u feel nothing at all
When ure heart turns cold
A baby's cry means nothing
A dead corpse is trivial
Mothers neglecting children is daily
Loneliness becomes your routine friend
Death seems like tranquility
Sleeping is never pleasant
If you even sleep at all
U forget ideals and turn off the reason
2 make sure the product is sold
You don't understand how I behave
Just wait till your heart turns Cold!

I know my cold heart turns warm at the front door
Love my family, love my Outlawz
But when I step outside I feel my blood freezing
Question if it's a blessing that 'm still breathing
Sometimes I wonder if I'm better off dead
They say God don't make mistakes but what if he did
But what if he didn't
So I'm supposed to be living this life that I'm living
And feeling how I'm feeling
Black rain shower, the pain builds character
My heart turned cold, yeah I learned to be a scavenger
Listen, no love received and no love given
Don't blame us blame the hate that you gave the children

No remorse for life and y'all forced to fight
In the event of my demise I hope God's the guiding light
In hind's sight, I'm lost, misguided by lies and truths
Confused bout what to do, refer to smoking, drinking brew
We be the hearts of the heartless, riding few from the bunch
Bosses have falled, bosses have caught you don't be the next one
Sleeping never pleasant even if you sleeping at all
The reason that I'm breathing is I'm an example for y'all

When your heart turns cold
It causes your soul to freeze
Spreads through your spirit like a deadly disease
When your heart turns cold
You feel nothing at all
A baby's cry means nothing at all
When your heart turns cold
A dead corpse is trivial
And death seems like tranquility
When your heart turns cold
I thank God above
Through the pain, hate, joy, and love
When your heart turns cold

Your soul is numb, your days are numbered (Cold)
Your kids cold, get old and younger (Cold)
Your loneliness becomes your only homie
So your sorrow all alone is just for your eyes only (Yeah)
The world against you and the odds are stacked (They stacked)
Your pockets short and your girls a wreck (That bitch)
Lose a piece of you survive all that
Plus you young and you black, it's hard enough being that (Yeah)
Your mom gone ain't nobody never cared (Yeah)
You call your mom but nobody never there (Shit)
Now it's on, you need a way up out of here
You click on some be next shit

When your heart turn cold that's when the heat go off
And the means die slow, that's how the streets show off
Cemeteries filled with victims those with cold hearts
Deep in the dark when the pistols spark
My life one big movie of strife
Scene after scene filled with nothing but sad dreams
No wonder my heart pumps ice water
Gotta live according to the lessons that life taught you
Lonely is the road of a tortured soul
Who only knows the roles of a heart turned cold
Caught in the middle when the pistols blow
That's how it go when your heart turns cold

When your heart turns cold
It causes your soul to freeze
Spreads through your spirit like a deadly disease
When your heart turns cold
You feel nothing at all
A baby's cry means nothing at all
When your heart turns cold
A dead corpse is trivial
And death seems like tranquility
When your heart turns cold
I thank God above
Through the pain, hate, joy, and love
When your heart turns cold"

The day, I met you
I saw strength
And I knew from, that point on
That you were pure, woman
Posessing a spirit that was strong
I want smiles to replace the sorrow
That you've encountered in the past
And since it was strength, that attracted me to you
It will take strength to make it last
My, negative side will attempt to, change you
But please fight that with your aura
It will be your strength, that keep us both standing
While others around us, fall
Black woman, black woman, black woman

Black woman, black woman, ohhhh black woman

I want smiles to replace the sorrow
That you have encountered in the past
And since it was strength, that attracted me to you
It will take strength
To make it last
My, negative side will attempt to change you
But please
Fight that with your aura
It will be your strength, that keep us both standing
While others around us, fall
Keep us standing, while things around us fall
It's your spirit, your strong beautiful spirit
That makes us both stand
Black woman, it is your beauty
It is your pureness, it is you, and all your love
That make us both stand
Black woman, you are pure, woman to me
Black woman, you are pure, love to me
Black woman, you are pure, joy to me"

Where there is a will there is a way

I don't know why the caged bird sings
But as long as Thug Life in my veins I be doin' my thing
These blocks raised me to hustle for change
I learned the hard way without pain there is no gain
My life experience is trapped on page
My thoughts in my brain release when I be rappin' on stage
I'm like a prophet of rage with a Glock and a guage
I bang for my gang, won't hesitate to cock it and blaze
Some years in this game can teach ya some things
I've seen many try and fail but the strong remain
My uncle Boo been locked away since I signed my name
And I opened to family and friends for fortune and fame

Ricochet shots cover my head in the same sights

And the same fiends I pass by I ask why
Get the answer smoke cancer and slide

Hey, ooh ah ooh oh oh
When your hero falls from grace
All your fairy tales are uncovered
Myths exposed and pain magnified
The greatest pain discovered
You told me to be strong but I'm confused to see you so weak
You said to never to give up and it hurts to see you welcoming me
When your hero falls so do the stars
When your hero falls so do the stars
And so does the perception of tomorrow
Without my hero there is only me alone
To deal with my sorrow, to deal with my sorrow
Your insistance to work and your soul is not happy at all
What do you expect it to do when your hero falls
So do the stars
See I know you're wondering how do I carry on
You want to give up you feel there's nobody to love
But if you look around there's so many people have been what you been
Through
You gotta let go you gotta be strong oh
Sing it again one more time
When your hero falls (Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
When your hero falls (Ooh yeah)
When your hero falls (What am I supposed to do)
When your hero falls (When I'm looking to you yeah)
When your hero falls (But you told me to be strong)
When your hero falls (And to never give up oh oh)
When your only hero falls (Say it again)
When your hero falls (Whoa, oh yeah)
When your hero falls (Oh oh)
When your hero falls (What you saying)
When your hero falls (Won't you listen to the children sing)
When your hero falls (As they sing it to the whole world)
When your hero falls (Oh oh, oh oh yeah)
When your only hero falls"

Whattup 'Pac?
This for my dog, 2Pac Shakur, 2Pac Shakur

Fueled with hidden hate (fueled with hidden hate)
Scared of bein outcast (scared of bein outcast, scared of being an outcast)
Afraid of common fate (afraid of common fate)
Today is built on tragedy (today, is built on tragedy)
Which no one wants to face, which no one wants to face
Nightmares to humanity (nightmares, to humanity)
And morally disgraces (and morallyyyyyyyyy disgraced)
But tomorrow, I see change (heh)
A chance to build anew
Tomorrow, I see change (chaaaaaaange)
A chance to build anew
Today is filled with rage, violence fills the air
Children bred with foolishness, cause no one cares
Today I lay my head down, but the pressure never stops
Gnawin at my sanity, content when I am dropped
But tomorrow, I see change...
Tomorrow, I see change (but tomorrow, I see change)
But tomorrow, I see change
A chance to build anew
Built on spirit, content of heart
And ideals based on truth
And tomorrow's the same way
I'm strong, because of my pride
To know I fought with all my heart
To keep my dreams alive

And tomorrow (heyyyyyyyyyyyyyeahhhheyy)
Tomorrow...
Tomorrow (ooooooooh tomorrow tomorrow...)
And tomorrow"

If I fail get back, can't be soft got to be tough
If I fall get back, can't be soft got to be tough

Failure, it's not an option
Real recognize real let's get it poppin'
With mathematics you can solve any problem
That's how we make it from the top to the bottom
Keep ya head up homie and stay confident
It's negativity around but I'm positive
Cuz I'm givin' everything that I got to give
Stayin' true to myself, that's how I keep it real

Like a phoenix before yo eyes
Out the ashes and from the dirt
Report for duty and put in work
Eternal life, an iron will
Man sharpens man, steel sharpens steel
The hate you gave, we turn to love
Rest in peace, one thug one love

We can't be stopped if we don't give up
Even though they hold us back we still find ways to come up
A lot of people make promises with no plans to keep 'em
But me, no matter what I'm ridin' 'til I get my freedom
If I fail, then it's only a challenge to go harder
Don't want to be no martyr so I adapt to things smarter
It's death before dishonor
And I put that on my son and my momma
And don't take it as a threat, that's a promise

Word is bond, bond is life
I give my life before my word shall fail
A soldier's oath, freedom of death
And I won't stop if I fail
Word is bond, bond is life
I give my life before my word shall fail
A soldier's oath, freedom of death
And I won't stop if I fail

If in my quest to achieve my goals
I stumble or crumble or even lose my soul
Those that knew me would easily co-sign
That there was never a life as hard as mine
No father, no money, no chance, no guide
I only follow my voice inside
If it guides me wrong and I do not win
I'll learn from mistakes and try to achieve again

Dedicated to the youth, the truth is the seed
The stronger the root, the stronger the tree
If we eat from the fruit, the stronger we be
If we do it today, tomorrow we free
Dedicated to the youth, the truth is the seed
The stronger the root, the stronger the tree
If we eat from the fruit, the stronger we be
If we do it today, tomorrow we free

To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
Uh-huh-huh, and my ambitions as a ridah
To catch her while she hot and horny, go up inside her
Then I spit some game in her ear, ""Go to the telly, ho!""
Equipped with money in a Benz 'cause, bitch, I'm barely broke
I'm smokin' bomb-ass weed, feelin' crucial
From player to player, the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
From hustlin' and prayers to breakin' motherfuckers to pay up
I got no time for these bitches, 'cause these hoes try to play us
I'm on a meal ticket mission, want a mil' so I'm wishin'
Competition got me ripped on that bullshit they stressin' (Booyah!)
I'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's mandatory
No guts, no glory, my nigga, bitch got the game distorted
Now it's on and it's on because I said so
Can't trust a bitch in the business so I got with Death Row
Now these money-hungry bitches gettin' suspicious
Started plottin' and plannin' on schemes to come and trick us

Got problems, then handle it, motherfuckers see me
These niggas is jealous

I suffered through the years

Label me greedy gettin' green, but seldom seen

Menacin' methods, label me a lethal weapon
Makin' niggas die witnessin' breathless imperfections
Can you picture my specific plan?
To be the man in this wicked land, underhanded hits are planned
These scams are plotted over grams and rocks
Outlawz motherfuckers die by the random shots
We all die in the end, so revenge we swore
I was all about my ends, fuck friends and foes
Me, a born leader, never leave the block without my heater
Got me a dog and named her ""my bitch nigga eater""
What could they do to me, you lil' brat?
Shit, them niggas that shot me is still terrified I'll get they ass
How can I show you how I feel inside?
We Outlawz, motherfuckers can't kill my pride
Niggas talk a lot of shit, but that's after I'm gone
‘Cause they fear me in the physical form
Let it be known I'm troublesome

Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na-na na, nahhh
Na, na, na, na
All you niggas die

Gutter ways, my mentality is ghetto
We guerrilla in this criminal war, we all rebels
Death before dishonor, bet I bomb on 'em first
Niggas knew we came for murder, pullin' up in a hearse
Westside was the war cry, bustin' off freely
Screamin', ""Fuck all y'all niggas!"" in Swahili
Pistol packin', fresh out of jail, I ain't goin' back
Release me to the care of my heartless strap
Say my name three times like Candyman
Bet I roll on yo' ass, like an avalanche
A sole survivor, learned to get high and pull drive-bys
Murder my foes, can't control my nine
Hearin' thoughts of my enemies pleadin', ""please""
Busta-ass motherfuckers tried to flee
Picture me lettin' this chump survive
Ran up on his ass, when I dumped he died
‘Cause I'm troublesome

Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na-na na, nahhh
Na, na, na, na
All you niggas die

""Murder, murder, my mind state,"" shit ain't changed
Since my last rhyme; the crime rate ain't decline
Niggas bustin' shots like they lost they mind
Like 25 to life never crossed they mind
Tell me young nigga never learned a thang
Dead at thirteen ‘cause he yearned to bang
Sent a lot of flowers, but how could I cry?
Need to stop the gang bangin', ""Either stop or die.""
Mercy is for the weak, when I speak I scream
Afraid to sleep, I'm havin' crazy dreams
Vivid pictures of my enemies, family times
Lord, forgive me ‘cause it's wrong, but I plan to die
Either take me in Heaven and understand I was a sheep
Did the best I could, raised in insanity
Or send me to Hell, ‘cause I ain't beggin' for my life
Ain't nothin' worse than this cursed-ass hopeless life
Nigga, we're troublesome

Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na-na na, nahhh
Na, na, na, na
All you niggas die

One love to my nigga Suge
What's up nigga?
Sweaty ass
You know"

Biggie Smalls and Junior M.A.F.I.A. is some mark-ass bitches
We keep on comin' while we runnin' for your jewels
Steady gunnin', keep on bustin' at them fools, you know the rules
Lil' Caesar, go ask your homie how I'll leave ya
Cut your young-ass up, leave you in pieces, now be deceased
Lil' Kim, don't fuck around with real G's
Quick to snatch yo' ugly ass off the streets, so fuck peace!
I'll let them niggas know it's on for life
Don't let the Westside ride tonight
Bad Boy murdered on wax and killed
Fuck with me and get yo' caps peeled, you know
My niggas say

See, grab your Glocks when you see 2Pac
Call the cops when you see 2Pac, uh
Who shot me? But you punks didn't finish
Now you 'bout to feel the wrath of a menace
Nigga, I hit 'em up!

West Coast for life

Get out the way yo, get out the way yo
Biggie Smalls just got dropped
Little Moo', pass the MAC
And let me hit him in his back
Frank White needs to get spanked right for settin' traps
Little accident murderer
And I ain't never heard of ya
Poisonous gats attack when I'm servin' ya
Spank ya, shank ya whole style when I gank
Guard your rank 'cause I'ma slam your ass in the paint
Puffy weaker than the fuckin' block I'm runnin' through, nigga
And I'm smokin' Junior M.A.F.I.A. in front of you, nigga
With the ready power
Tucked in my Guess under my Eddie Bauer
Your clout petty/sour
I push packages every hour
Hit 'em up!

Oh, call the cops when you see 2Pac, uh
Who shot me? But you punks didn't finish
Now you 'bout to feel the wrath of a menace
Nigga, we hit 'em up!

Peep how we do it, keep it real as penitentiary steel
This ain't no freestyle battle, all you niggas gettin' killed
With your mouths open
Tryna come up off of me, you in the clouds hopin'
Smokin' dope, it's like a sherm high
Niggas think they learned to fly
But they burn, motherfucker, you deserve to die
Talkin' about you gettin' money, but it's funny to me
All you niggas livin' bummy while you fuckin' with me
I'm a self-made millionaire
Thug livin', out of prison, pistols in the air (Ha, ha)
Biggie, remember when I used to let you sleep on the couch
And beg a bitch to let you sleep in the house?
Now it's all about Versace, you copied my style
Five shots couldn't drop me, I took it and smiled
Now I'm back to set the record straight
With my AK, I'm still the thug that you love to hate
Motherfucker, we hit 'em up!

I'm from N-E-W Jers' where plenty of murders occurs
No points or commas, we bring drama to all you herbs
Now go check the scenario: Lil' Cease
I'll bring you fake G's to your knees, coppin' pleas in de Janeiro
Little Kim, is you coked up or doped up?
Get your little Junior Whopper click smoked up
What the fuck, is you stupid?
I take money, crash and mash through Brooklyn
With my click lootin', shootin' and pollutin' your block
With a 15-shot cocked Glock to your knot
Outlaw MAFIA clique movin' up another notch
And your pop stars popped and get mopped and dropped
All your fake-ass East Coast props brainstormed and locked

You's a beat biter, a Pac style taker
I'll tell you to your face you ain't shit but a faker
Softer than Alize with a chaser
About to get murdered for the paper
E.D.I. Mean approach the scene of the caper
Like a loc, with Little Ceas' in a choke
Gun totin' smoke, we ain't no motherfuckin' joke
We them niggas, better be knowin'
We approachin' in the wide open, gun smokin'
No need for hopin', it's a battle lost
I got 'em crossed as soon as the funk is boppin' off
Nigga, we hit 'em up!

We hit  him up
Call the cops when you see 2Pac
Say what? (Come on with the next shit)
Call the cops when you see 2Pac

My enemies dead n buried, now the stress is through
But that's a dream, though it seems like reality
There'll never be peace long as there’s fiends on these Cali streets
Even on the other side brothers die, but ride
Niggas get high off a slow form of suicide
Hide the closest thoughts, the war is fought as casualties
I live my life to fuckin' mo', exposin' tragically
How can we find some peace and niggas still ain't get a piece
I know I'm probably hell-bound, but we got to eat
I'm seeing Satan infiltratin'; my military mind
Make me hustle all the time, go out for cash makin
Forgive my adversaries they don't understand what we go through

Hittin' ya back, you ain't kickin' no facts
Fakin' jacks, you and ya bitch clique could get this AK

You're about to witness something you never thought you'd witness
Before
Check this out

Welcome to the house the D-O double G built
We got honey, cream, silk and milk
We make that big bank and keep that big shank
Just in case we get slapped into the home we take
Nigga don't think Dogg slips at all
I make chips for crips and the beat dogs
True niggas, do niggas, hey you niggas
Can't get with us cuz we rip shit up
It's Mack Dime, and D-O dub
Here's a toast to the most, westcoast love
Fo sho though, I let you know from the get go
Pullin on my endo, rollin through the Wood with my kin dog

Not De La Soul, but fresh on parole
Now it's all about the hustle with the pebbles on swole
I'm know to the peoples as the Inglewood swanger
Been rollin gold Danas since a BG banger
It's a dog eat dog world in the city that I'm claimin
And niggas say we bangin cuz our colors be flamin
But I'd rather push crack, let the bank roll stack
I show Snoop how to whoop and then I front him a sack

Nigga better blue tennis shoes tidy, with our body
As I fall into the Mack 10 listenin party
Got greeted by some niggas who I never knew
Cold thing about it is that the niggas kept it true
Inglewood family is what they claim to bang
Street Rue and Maddog, I think that was his name
But anyway, what can I say?
Oh by the way, it's anybody 'kay?
So when you in LA, or nigga round my way
Give me a holler on the 310 or 213, yeah
 X 3
Long Beach, with the ING

I'm makin green in the rap scene from coast to coast
And rollin three wheel motion from the woods to the ocean
See Snoop and Tray Dee in the LBC
And wasn't nobody trippin, just cool as can be
No harm up in (?) so the hatas got bigger
But they figure platinum niggas keep a gold plated trigger
And that's fo sho though, you know how it go
Jump in the low low and bang with the homies, fuck a ho
So keep away crack and leave your bullet proof vest
Dogg there ain't no need for that, we headed west to the QS
Game recognize game, and it always should
It's all good and you niggas got a passion, Inglewood
Whoever trip get caught up in the middle like Monie
That's on the one and only I keep the big homies for the phonies
So let it be known, from my hood to your town
That connect game niggas is straight down with the Pound

Now all my peoples in the LBC pull up a chair and have a dime bag on me
See we be DPGin this, we in this thang to make hits and bump a
Bitch and maintain
Cuz the more better you get, the more cheddar you get
The more shit you talk, the more wet up you get
See, I found out quick, don't say shit
Just take care of yours, and handle it quick
Yeah, it don't stop for Biggie or 2Pac
Niggas been gettin shot on my block
But we got to make a change and the thang is this
I keep my heater by my seater just in case y'all twist
But I wish upon a star
To stay down with Mack Dime, pushin caviar
The real recognize the real, I'll kill for that nigga
ING DPG, deal with it nigga, for real
 X 2

They live on the streets, and they hustle for fame
Some claim twenty crip but most claim insane
See it's not a lifestyle, it's a full time job
And if you live in Long Beach, it's like a macabre
]From blunt to blunt, everybody's bad
And if you don't know where you at you better tuck in your rag
Push heat on the street, with Chuck D's on his feet
Makin money slangin tapes up out the Compton swap meet

Up jumps the boogie some niggas gang bang
So keep a big steel if it's a real G Thang
But I kick back, relax, count hundreds by the stacks
And keep the yay on the stove till the whole key cracks
Ain't a busta in the crew, so I'm callin all hogs
It's connect gang rollin with the Pound and Snoop Dogg
And everythang all gravy like it's 'posed to be
It's Long Beach with the Ingle dub O-O-D city

This that new shit I wrote for the true sisters
They said I kept saying ""bitch"" too much
So I got this new shit for y’all
I swear I never call you bitch again

They gave my homie 90 days for domestic violence
I try to picture myself in this position but remain silent
I get to thinkin' 'bout this shit we been through
We close like kin, but you remain my friend too
This life of sin done got the both of us in trouble
But you always stay down for a nigga, so that’s why I love you
Reminiscin' needin' tissues, fightin' over childish issues
Swear I can't live with you; but without you, every day I miss you
When we roll you hold my pistol, my gangsta bitch-itch, you
Always in the mood for love, that's why I'm sleepin' with you
Though not the man of your dreams
My plan and scheme’s to be rich like a king
And live my life trouble free, I see
Yesterday I called you names and played games on your mind
I promise that I’ll change in time
It's a complicated world, so girl, just be a friend
I swear I’ll never call you bitch again, believe me

Uh, never, Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
I swear I'll never call you bitch again, believe me

I wake up early in the mornin', at the crack of dawn
Nigga still tired so I'm yawnin’, and now I'm gone
Tryin' to get my money on strong, so an early riser
Out before them other guys, that's the way to profit every time
Can't be too close my enemies, they see ghosts, they envy me
Plus we been beefin' with the East Coast, with casualties
Got stopped in traffic, had a warrant, so they gaffled me
But while I'm gone, watch my business and my back for me
My enemies think they got me goin', they ain't knowin'
Ain't no love for player haters where you cowards goin'
You paid bail, got me out of jail, home again
I promise not to leave you on your own again
Cristal corks are popped, romantic thoughts are dropped
It's so frantic but don't panic, ‘cause we crossed the top
Told you young lady ""you a woman and friend""
I swear I'll never call you bitch again, believe me

There's so many motherfuckers that I can include
Who's quick to blast motherfuckers in a feud?
It doesn't make a difference
'Cause it's about who's the quickest
On the draw to end all existence
For instance, let's take these Ruthless fools
These Ruthless fools and the Pound in one room
Assume, it's only for conversation
So let's conversate, slip a nigga the .38, then dip
Empty out the clip
Mind on set-trip, 'cause niggas talk shit

Now if a nigga had a prayer before a nigga died
Would the nigga be dead or would he stay alive?
And if I was in your own shoes, would I survive?
Probably not, you'd probably let your Glock go pop
Now drop to your knees
And picture raw ass gangsas flowin' in the breeze

Now what would you do
If you could fuck with me or my crew?
But you can't, so don't even think about
Steppin' in the motherfuckin' house

Them niggas from the other side recognize my face
Cause it's the O.G. D-O-double-G, L-B-C
I'm mad dogging niggas cause I don't care
Red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair
Niggas stare as I enter the center
They send me to a level three yard, that's where I stay
Late night I hear toothbrushes scraping on the floor
Niggas getting they shanks, just in case the war, pops off
Cause you can't tell what's next
My little homie Baby Boo took a pencil in his neck
And he probably won't make it to see twenty-two
I put that on Tha pound
I'ma ride for you Baby Boo

-Like 2Pac said, only God can judge me
-But I think only black Jesus can help me
Verse 1 (Kane)
Six in the morning and I see the sunrise
Wish I died in my sleep didn't want to open my eyes
To see this world so fucked up for me
And my family, worked so hard but can earn a decent salary
These bills keep whooping a nigga ass
Spent my whole check trying to dress with class
I found myself having to smoke weed just to chill
Both my parents got killed and I ain't cried still
All my niggas getting shot, peoples mama's smoking rock
And who the hell can stop these fucked up cops
They like to overseaers and we like the slave bitches
Offer pussy to a nigga even though they got AIDS
You jumping in that pussy thatn you diving in the grave
White man build the prison and the niggas come through
Like the motherfuckers giving out free barbeque
Lock a nigga up for life and say fuck you
Most of ya'll ain't make it pass the 12th grade
That's why you making minimum wage or slanging rocks for chump change
Alot of people died for the right to vote
We don't use white devils taking nigga land and missuse it
On top of that I think my uncle on crack
My boy Quay Shaun took a slug in his back
]From another black now he in the coma trying to make it back
Come on come on
My old lady think she pregnant I ain't got no cash for her
She probably fucking another nigga I wouldn't put it past her
My mind got me murderous like John Doe
Bitch ass niggas trying to play me like a hoe
And now I'm rolling round sucking on a steel dick
Bout to pull the trigger end it cause I'm tired of this bullshit
Know what I'm saying grown men don't cry
But the ghetto got me wheeping like a bitch I'm gone die on my knees
(Chorus)
Black Jesus tell me why this world so fucked up
Allah, tell me why this world so fucked up
Black Jesus tell me why this world so fucked up for me
For me a nigga
Verse 2 (Abel)
They say that I was dealt some bad cards in this game of life
But before I take my trip I'm gone leave with them stripes
Sending dime bags of weed, toting nines til nose bleeds
My nerve so bad I had to pop one of those b's
I had to strap my jimmy hat or catch this double mint disease
See the devil in a crack pipe pointing at me
I seen a nigga shaking just lke he caught the holy ghost
But he really scored a gram of heroin for 80 bones
I got them stones, if you take a hit you can't resist
Now I'm crying, I think one of my brothers on that shit
Do you care if you live or die, really I don't know
But if there's hell below I think we all gonna go
(Chorus)
Verse 3 (Master P)
Tell me is this heaven, is this hell
I ain't LL, but all I hear is funeral bells
The ghetto's trying to kill me, a born loser
A born hustler my uncle's a drug user
I'm from the projects or should I say the 3rd Ward
Where fools into killing and fiends walk like androids
Hooked up with the twins or should I say Kane & Abel
Trying to keep some change in my pockets, some food on my table
Verse 4 (Silkk)
You know what P your right
Cause Silkk was on the block like last night
Niggas doing anything from selling drugs
To sell mugs smoking that glass pipe
I'm from a messed up city where niggas don't live long
They parents out-live they kids
Rest in peace to my homie they like split his wig
Now who won't walk that last mile to they death
Imaging taking a deep (inhales) that was your last breath
Just imaging your mom was prostituting your mom was smoking
Imagine your eyes don't close imagine your eyes don't open
I be like trying to keep the world and stay TRU
There's too much drama in my hood, gotta stay cool
Verse 5 (Master P)
As I lay me down to sleep
Black Jesus if you real, take me out this ghetto g
Cause its crazy its wicked
I got niggas on every block trying to get a meal, ticket
They killing they murder
Little kids in 3 inch girdles
And life is just like Pac Man
Niggas gumping up niggas but who gone be the next man
To lose his shoes, I mean lose his life
Who gone think twice, dying in this ghetto life
Cause in the White House, politicians run the country
But where I'm from in the ghetto's its bout drug money
Ice cream slanging
Niggas banging red and blue everybody's hanging
Niggas bout it, little kids get rowdy
But will I make it out this ghetto, I doubt it
(Kane & Abel talking)
I think the devil trying to get me to sell my soul
He keep on walking with me, he keep on talking with me
I think the devil's trying to get me to sell my soul
He trying to temp me with the bitches and money
Black Jesus black jesus if you feel me
Than save me and my ghetto people"

I know the pussy's mine
So I'mma fuck a couple more times
And then I'm through with it
There's nothing else to do with it
Pass it to the homie, now you hit it
Cause she ain't nothing but a bitch to me
And y'all know that bitches ain't shit to me
I gives a fuck
Why don't y'all pay attention
Approach her with a different proposition

Guess who back in the motherfucking house
With a fat dick for your motherfucking mouth
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
Cause when bitches get scandalous and pull a voodoo
What you gon' do?
You really don't know
So I'd advise you not to trust that hoe
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
Knowing damn well I'm too caught up with my grip
Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger
How many bitches wanna fuck this nigga named Snoop
Doggy, I'm all the above
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
But see it ain't no fun
If my homies can't get a taste of it
Cause you know I don't love it

Touch of this twister, stylistic mixture
What I create pulsates, there is no escape
Annihilate your mental mindstate (Motherfucker)
Dre labels my vocabulary abusive
I packs more knowledge than Confucius, I'm deadly
Induce you like Medusa, with thoughts to shed
And niggas throughout this hemisphere, far and near
Prepare, catch me chillin' like the winter
Up against the number one contender, as I enter
Cause I gets heated like friction
Motherfuck your whole jurisdiction, react this fact not fiction
Telepathic addiction, to this homicidal recital
Dangerous and vital to all my rivals
Suicidal, brainwaves conveys
To the average motherfucker's minds these days

Take ten steps and turn to shoot the first nigga smirkin

Into bits and pieces lyrical telekinesis
Gets me into verbally vindictive
Violent vocabulary bobs to existence
Catch me in the pitch black path
I sit and let the sick thought pass through my mental
Till I hear an instrumental
And detrimental verbals get to spittin'
The highest in intellect, try connectin' with the written
Now they faced with the forbidden, vocally chosen
To explore new terrain, then remain unseen, throughout the war

With my mind on my money and my money on my mind
We do this everyday about the same time, beyotch!

I was at the park one day, that's when I saw her face
She looked kind of cavi to me

Parks my ride as I, steps inside, as I

But you know how that goes
We flow toe for toe, if you ain't on the Row
Fuck you and your ho, really doe, so check it
It's Snoop Doggy Dogg on the solo tip
Still clockin' grip, and don't really give a shit
About nuttin' at all, just my Doggs, steppin' through the fog
And I'm still gonna fade 'em all
With the gangsta shit that keeps ya hangin'
How many bitches in the house will I be bangin'?
Every single one, to get the job done
As I dip, skip, flip, right back to two one
Where the sun be shinin' and I be ryhmin'
It's me, Snoop D-O-double-G and I'm climbin', I'm climbin'

If I did it then I done it, then a battle just started
And I'm gunnin' for niggas who ain't down who I ride for
Dat nigga Daz, Kurupt, Dogg Pound, Death Row
Here we go, Blood or Crip, it don't matter
I blast and outcast those who separate me from my goals
Without a doubt, kill 'em and turn 'em out (What)
Notice the way that I shake, rattle and roll
And like your mamma cryin', enthusiastic as two nines
Kaboom, we mash to the extreme as a team
Scope you out and cut you down like a guillotine (Know what I mean?)
I hung a string of MC's who thought foolishness
Schoolin' this whole rap game, we rulin' this
We doin' this, pursuin' this major
Stackin' major paper, with my Dogg street behavior
I caved ya chest in, bruised ya ribs with a blow of skills
Like Tyson, knockin' your ass out like Bruno
You know I bring death towards your whole fuckin' camp
Get in your skin, kill anything that lives
I never ever thought Dr. Dre could come rough
Call your bluff, comin' with skills to smash your stuff
You know it's hardcore, you know it's raw
You know it's hardcore, I'll break your jaw
Too many times with rhymes I combine
And blow minds with the ways I design too many fuckin' times

Hey Daz, the author of authentics (that's me)
When I was young I played games with skirt
Hide and go get it 'til I was laced in a clinic (Oh shit)
Learned quick to always keep a leash and hat on my dick
(Slow down)
I know you're trippin' off me and what play I threw
But I ain't trippin' off you and what you say I do
It's time for war, man, they all runnin' again
Empty clip, reload, start gunnin' again
I remember, ""Kurupt, you'll never get that far""
No matter who you are, I found you can shine like stars
I used patience and the planet of my sight
To the corner of deuce-five where it's lot like life
I'm put in a position where I thinks
And I'm 'bout to beat MC's purple, blue and pink
Take what's yours (Yours)
Break down your doors (Doors)
Hardcore radical, rough and raw
When you come talkin' what you talk
It's me, I'm 'bout stalk and I rock it from L.A. to New York
On to the city of Phil' where all my niggas at keepin' it real
All we in sharin' here to the south to the east to the north
Kurupt, grabbin' it about to rip it off
I rocks the West, so tell me who rocks the best
I rocks the spot without Glocks and homicidal shots
I leave the scene like a quake 'cause I leave 'em shakin'
They all shake tryin' to take the money that I make
You'll never get past three rounds
Three rhymes, three MC's in three towns
I came to put it down (Fuck that)
And lay all three of these motherfuckers down on the ground now

(You know, it's me in your world, Daz)
It's about the bitches
(Nah, it's about the cash)
Move quick
(Move fast)
The real again
(Leave a motherfucker stranded like Gilligan)
Kill and I kill again
I got money on my mind
I'm posted at the Palms
Sittin' in my room with a pad
(Writin' rhymes, dimes on the nickels)
Nickels on the dimes
To quarters, thousands
To million dollar bonds

And it don't take much, for the Dogg Pound to bust a cap
In your ass, for getting us all fucked up
Now check it, it's a calling for niggas like Doggs
Who supposed to be the shit, but steadily bitchin' like hoes

Stay full of that gin and juice and have a ball

I packs a strap, like that, I kicks it like this
Now how many bitches must get dicked?
Before they say, okay, Daz that nigga from back in the day
Ya never ever thought I'd see him bustin with Dr. Dre
Cuz I grips mics, I rips mics in half
Hoes be coming to my flat so I can tap that ass

'Cause they got me on the run

""Free 2Pac"" is all that's on a nigga's mind
But at the same time, it seems they tryin' to take mine
So I’ma get smart and get defensive and shit
And put together a Million March for some gangsta shit

So now they got us laced
Two multi-millionaire motherfuckers catchin’ cases
Bitches get ready for the throwdown, the shit's about to go down
Me and Snoop about to clown
I’m losin' my religion, I'm vicious on these stool pigeons
You might be deep in this game, but you got the rules missin'
Niggas be actin’ like they savage, I'm out to get the cabbage
I've got nothin' but love for my niggas livin' savage

I've got a pit named Petey, she Nigerina
I've got a house out in the hills right next to Chino
And I think I've got a black Bimmer
But my dream is to own a fly casino
Like Bugsy Siegel, and do it all legal
And get scooped up by the little homie in the Regal
It feels good to you, baby-bubba
You see, this is for the G's and the keys, motherfucker

You might get your first snatch before your eyes swirl
You doin' your job every day
And then you work so hard 'til your hair turns gray

They tell me not to roll with my Glock

Floatin' in the black Benz, tryin' to do a show a day

Schemes for currency and dough-related
Affiliated with the hustlers, so we made it

This life as a rap star is nothin' without guard

Left me alone, I grew up amongst a dyin' breed

Until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest
Tell me, can you feel me? I'm not livin' in the past
You wanna last? Be the first to blast
Remember Kato, no longer with us, he's deceased
Call on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets
Now he rest in peace
Is there a heaven for a G? Remember me
So many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears

Lord, God
Shed so many tears
Lord, God
Shed so many tears

Now that I'm strugglin' in this business, by any means
Label me greedy gettin' green, but seldom seen
And fuck the world 'cause I'm cursed
I'm havin' visions of leavin' here in a hearse
God, can you feel me? I'm not livin' in the past
You wanna last? Be the first to last

Hey, yo, go to the next shit
Hey, yo, I got some new shit for you tonight

Hearin' thoughts of my enemies pleadin', ""please""
Busta-ass motherfuckers tried to flee
Picture me lettin' this chump survive
Ran up on his ass, when I dumped he died
‘Cause I'm troublesome

La la la la, la, la
La, la-la la, lahhh
La, la, lahhh
All you niggas die

""Murder, murder, my mind state,"" shit ain't changed
Since my last rhyme; the crime rate ain't decline
Niggas bustin' shots like they lost they mind
Like 25 to life never crossed they mind
Tell me young nigga (never learned a thang)
Dead at thirteen ‘cause he yearned to bang
Sent a lot of flowers, but how could I cry?
Tried to warn the little nigga, ""Either stop or die.""
Mercy is for the weak, when I speak I scream
Afraid to sleep, I'm havin' crazy dreams
Vivid pictures of my enemies, family times
God forgive me ‘cause it's wrong, but I plan to die
Either take me in Heaven and understand I was a G
Did the best I could, raised in insanity
Or send me to Hell, ‘cause I ain't beggin' for my life
Ain't nothin' worse than this cursed-ass hopeless life
I'm troublesome

La la la la, la, la
La, la-la la, lahhh
La, la, lahhh
All you niggas die

One love to my nigga Suge
What's good, my nigga?
Sweaty ass
You know
Yuh!"

If you think there's no justice, think again
Now only inside where they keep the baddest of the bad
If you do the crime, you might do the time

Aye yo
I think y'all gonna like this next song
When this song drop, I want all the West Coast people to give some love on this next song
(Y'all gotta go crazy)
They try to ban this song
They don't wanna play my song, but they wanna play Fat Boy all goddamn day

What!
C'mon, c'mon
(Take money)
C'mon, c'mon
(Take money)
C'mon, c'mon
What's up niggas!?

First off, fuck yo' bitch and the clique you claim
Westside when we ride, come equipped with game
You claim to be a player, but I fucked your wife
We bust on Bad Boys, niggas fucked for life
Plus, Puffy tryna see me, weak hearts I rip
Biggie Smalls and Junior M.A.F.I.A. is some mark-ass bitches
We keep on comin' while we runnin' for your jewels
Steady gunnin', keep on bustin' at them fools, you know the rules
Lil' Caesar, go ask your homie how I'll leave ya
Cut your young-ass up, leave you in pieces, now be deceased
Lil' Kim, don't fuck around with real G's
Quick to snatch yo' ugly ass off the streets, so fuck peace!
I'll let them niggas know it's on for life
Don't let the Westside ride tonight (ha ha ha)
Bad Boy murdered on wax and killed
Fuck with me and get yo' caps peeled, you know
Niggas say

See, grab your Glocks when you see 2Pac
Call the cops when you see 2Pac, uh
Who shot me? But you punks didn't finish
Now you 'bout to feel the wrath of a menace
Nigga, we hit 'em up!
Yes y'all
Outlawz in this motherfucker
West Coast for life

Get out the way yo, get out the way yo
Biggie Smalls just got shot
Little Moo', pass the MAC
And let me hit him in his back
Frank White needs to get spanked right for settin' traps
Little accident murderer
And I ain't never heard of ya
Poisonous gats attack when I'm servin' ya
Spank ya, shank ya whole style when I gank
Guard your rank 'cause I'ma slam your ass in the paint
Puffy weaker than the fuckin' block I'm runnin' through, nigga
And I'm smokin' Junior M.A.F.I.A. in front of you, nigga
With the ready power
Tucked in my Guess under my Eddie Bauer
Your clout petty/sour
I push packages every hour, I hit 'em up!

Call the cops when you see 2Pac, uh
Who shot me? But you punks didn't finish
Now you 'bout to feel the wrath of a menace
Nigga, say what?

Peep how we do it, keep it real as penitentiary steel
This ain't no freestyle battle, all you niggas gettin' killed
With your mouths open
Tryna come up off of me, you in the clouds hopin'
Smokin' dope, it's like a sherm high
Niggas think they learned to fly
But they burn, motherfucker, you deserve to die
Talkin' about you gettin' money, but it's funny to me
All you niggas livin' bummy while you fuckin' with me
I'm a self-made millionaire
Thug livin', out of prison, pistols in the air (ha ha)
Biggie, remember when I used to let you sleep on the couch
And beg a bitch to let you sleep in the house?
Now it's all about Versace, you copied my style
Five shots couldn't drop me, I took it and smiled
Now I'm back to set the record straight
With my AK, I'm still the thug that you love to hate
Motherfucker, I hit 'em up!

I'm from N-E-W Jers' where plenty of murders occurs
No points or commas, we bring drama to all you herbs
Now go check the scenario: Lil' Cease
I'll bring you fake G's to your knees, coppin' pleas in de Janeiro
Little Kim, is you coked up or doped up?
Get your little Junior Whopper click smoked up
What the fuck, is you stupid?
I take money, crash and mash through Brooklyn
With my click lootin', shootin' and pollutin' your block
With a 15-shot cocked Glock to your knot
Outlaw MAFIA clique movin' up another notch
And your pop stars popped and get mopped and dropped
All your fake-ass East Coast props brainstormed and locked

You's a beat biter, a Pac style taker
I'll tell you to your face you ain't shit but a faker
Softer than Alize with a chaser
About to get murdered for the paper
E.D.I. Mean approach the scene of the caper
Like a loc, with Little Ceas' in a choke
Gun totin' smoke, we ain't no motherfuckin' joke
And it better be knowin'
We approachin' in the wide open, gun smokin'
No need for hopin', it's a battle lost
I got 'em crossed as soon as the funk is boppin' off
Nigga, we hit 'em up!

We hit him up
Call the cops when you see 2Pac
Say what? (Come on with the next shit)
Call the cops when you see 2Pac
Who shot me? But you punks didn't finish
Now you 'bout to feel the wrath of a menace

Don't want to hurt a soul nigga, so don't make me
I got a dream to see my whole team in Lexus Coupes
My enemies dead n buried, now the stress is through
But that’s a dream, though it seems like reality
There’ll never be peace long as there's fiends on these Cali streets
Even on the other side brothers die, but ride
Niggas get high off a slow form of suicide
Hide the closest thoughts, the war is fought as casualties
I live my life to fuckin mo’, exposin tragically
How can we find some peace and niggas still ain't get a piece
I know I'm probably hellbound, but we got to eat
I'm seeing Satan infiltratin, my military mind
Make me hustle all the time, go out for cash makin
Forgive my adversaries they don’t understand what we go through

We close like kin, but you remain my friend too
This life of sin done got the both of us in trouble
But you always stay down for a nigga, so that’s why I love you
Reminiscin' needin' tissues, fightin' over childish issues
Swear I can't live with you; but without you, every day I miss you
When we roll you hold my pistol, my gangsta bitch-itch, you
Always in the mood for love, that's why I'm sleepin' with you
Though not the man of your dreams
My plan and scheme’s to be rich like a king
And live my life trouble free, I see

I promise that I’ll change in time

Tryin' to get my money on strong, so an early riser
Out before them other guys, that's the way to profit every time
Can't be too close my enemies, they see ghosts, they envy me
Plus we been beefin' with the East Coast, with casualties
Got stopped in traffic, had a warrant, so they gaffled me
But while I'm gone, watch my business and my back for me
My enemies think they got me goin', they ain't knowin'
Ain't no love for player haters where you cowards goin'
You paid bail, got me out of jail, home again
I promise not to leave you on your own again
Cristal corks are popped, romantic thoughts are dropped
It's so frantic but don't panic, ‘cause we crossed the top
Told you young lady ""you a woman and friend""

Got a quarter pound of bud so I'm fucked up too
Seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve
Bailed back in the crib (For what?) Because I'm all-in
Conversated then I dug that hoe out
I fixed me some food, then boned the hell out, and said
Tomorrow, tomorrow, check it out
Here we go and we'll be back to dick you out
G's up, hoes down

I reminisce on that ass that I rizzocked

Yeahh, and I'm feelin' alright
Four A.M. as I stoll back to my crib
To see what's with my woman and my newborn kid
With my mind on my money and my money on my mind
We do this everyday about the same time, beyotch!

I was at the park one day, that's when I saw her face
She looked kind of cavi to me

Parks my ride as I, steps inside, as I

(Nothin' but a gangsta party
It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party)

Now give me fifty feet
Defeat is not my destiny, release me to the streets
And keep whatever's left of me
Jealousy is misery, sufferin' is greed
Better be prepared when you cowards fuck with me
I bust and flee, these niggas must be crazy, what?
There ain't no mercy motherfuckers who can't fade the thugs
You thought it was, but it wasn't, now disappear
Bow down in the presence of a boss player

It's like cuz, blood gang-bangin'
Everybody in the party doin' dope-slangin'
You gotta have papers in this world
You might get your first snatch before your eyes swirl
You doin' your job every day
And then you work so hard 'til your hair turns gray
Let me tell you 'bout life and 'bout the way it is
You see, we live by the strap, so we die by the strap, kids

They tell me not to roll with my Glock
So now I got a throw-away
Floatin' in the black Benz (Biatch), tryin' to do a show a day
They wonder how I live with five shots
Niggas is hard to kill on my block
Schemes for currency and dough-related
Affiliated with the hustlers, so we made it
No answers to questions, I'm tryin' to get up on it
My nigga Dogg with me, eternally the most wanted

Do the gangstas run this motherfucker?
(Hell yeah)
Now do the Lakers run this motherfucker?
(Hell yeah)
Do the gangsta run this motherfucker?
(Hell yeah)
Or do the ladies run this motherfucker?
(Hell yeah)

Soon as I step on the scene, I'm hearin' hoochies screamin'
Fiendin' for money and alcohol, the life of a Westside player
Where cowards die and the strong ball
Only in Cali where we riot, not rally, to live and die
In L.A. we wearin' Chucks, not Ballys
Dressed in Locs and Khaki suits, and ride is what we do
Flossin' but have caution: we collide with other crews
Famous because we program
Worldwide, let them recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumpin' and grindin' like a slow jam
It's Westside, so you know the Row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say, but give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A
From Oakland to Sac-town, the Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put their mack down, give me love!

Keep it rocking
Keep it rocking

This goes out to my homeboy 
If there ain't no justice for the dawg
Ain't no justice whatsoever

Back in elementary, I thrived on misery
Left me alone, I grew up amongst a dyin' breed
Inside my mind couldn't find a place to rest
Until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest
Tell me, can you feel me? I'm not livin' in the past
You wanna last? See the first to blast
Remember Kato, no longer with us, he's deceased
Call on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets
Now he rest in peace
Is there a heaven for a G? Remember me
So many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears

Lord, I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears

Now that I'm strugglin' in this business, by any means
Label me greedy gettin' green, but seldom seen
And fuck the world 'cause I'm cursed
I'm havin' visions of leavin' here in a hearse
God, can you feel me?
Take me away from all the pressure and all the pain
Show me some happiness again
I'm goin' blind, I spend my time in this cell, ain't livin' well
I know my destiny is Hell, where did I fail?
My life is in denial and when I die
Baptized in eternal fire, shed so many tears

Lord, I suffered through the years (C'mon wit' it)
And shed so many tears
Lord, I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
Lord, I suffered through the years

But in the lobby, Shakur was shot several times, including two graze wounds to the head. 2Pac's lawyers said the attack appeared to be a setup

Against doctors orders, 2Pac Shakur checked himself out of the hospital less than 24 hours after being shot 5 times on the way into a Manhattan recording studio

2Pac Shakur secures one clean legal victory this year, as he's dismissed of assault charges brought against him when he allegedly shot at two off-duty Atlantic cops on Halloween last year. The case was dismissed due to insufficient evidence

More controvery surrounding 2Pac Shakur ...

Meanwhile, in 2Pac news, at about 6:45 tonight, Shakur may have lowered his own chances of surviving the attack by checking himself out of the hospital that probably saved his life

2Pac Shakur checked into the Metropolitan Hospital yesterday under an assumed name. His lawyers said that he had connections, but wouldn't say what kind, that could provide top notch security for the injured rap star

Shakur underwent surgery today ...

The shooting of 2Pac Shakur here in New York City once again underscores the violence that has surrounded this man since he shot to superstardom in the world of music and entertainment"

I'm grievin' for the young gun
I'm thinkin' 'bout them young guns

Lil' homie got life, he was only sixteen
Lil' homie would pop pills, lil' homie would sip lean
Used to tell him all the time, lil' homie just get clean
Said ""I had to do it, Jelly, they were tryna kill me""
So I feel the weight on my shoulder blades
Know that any day I could explode with rage
The one that know the least always got the most to say
If it's made us strong nobody get blown away
Still I'm country as catfish with coleslaw
I done seen 'em get hit over a phone call
I done seen 'em go switch and outta toes y'all
I done seen a man go snitch on all his road dogs
Doin' this awhile and I don't feel it anymore
But I came a long way from when I'm kickin' in them doors
Told me build a legacy and I been buildin' it for sure
I've been dreamin' that I'm walkin' on a million dollar floor
Woke up on the dark side of the moon
Listen close, hear my soul singin' out of tune
And they say you're out of mind if you're outta fuel
I feel like I'm out my mind and without a clue
And I told my nephew, don't let 'em deceive you
You don't get another shot, you don't get a redo
You don't get another take, you don't get a sequel
So don't let it stress you, remember to keep cool

I light night skies with taillights
I hear those wolves call goodnight
I feel those flames burn inside
I wear no mask or disguise

I'm a young gun
They ask where do we come from
From a place where most people run from
Where the men of the family die so young
So the women gotta raise up the young ones
Goodnight to the young guns
Mama take care of the young ones
Grow up to be someone
I grew up to be a young gun

Mama cried when my daddy passed away
Then she stepped up to the plate to raise a man
And I ain't understand at the time, I was only ten
Had a feelin' that my destiny had been planned
I'll be damned if I end up like he did
Faster with the banger than Billy the Kid
Never had a father figure, only 2Pac and hard liquor
Ambitionz of a ridah, westside
Face first in the streets, all eyez on me
Tryna fill a legacy
Forty-five and I have a key so demons never leave
Even though mama prayed up, I still stayed up
Late nights in a dark alley
Call of the wild, screaming out, callin' my name
My soul has been pulled up by chains, back in the reins
Apache blood runs through my veins
Came from the flame so I cannot explain
The feelin' I get from the pain
Comfort I get from the chaos, at home on these streets
I can't stay off I'm lit like the candles in seance
They pray on my people and say that we're evil
We're dyin' by needles to fly with the eagles
They laws are illegal, immoral, deceitful
I guess I'm supposed to be passive and peaceful

I light night skies with taillights
I hear those wolves call goodnight
I feel those flames burn inside
I wear no mask or disguise

I'm a young gun
They ask where do we come from
From a place where most people run from
Where the men of the family die so young
So the women gotta raise up the young ones
Goodnight to the young guns
Mama take care of the young ones
Grow up to be someone
I grew up to be a young gun

I light night skies with taillights
I hear those wolves call goodnight
I feel those flames burn inside
I wear no mask or disguise
I'm a young gun"

I'm suicidal, so don't stand near me
My every move is a calculated step
To bring me closer to embrace an early death
Now there's nothin' left
There was no mercy on the streets
I couldn't rest, I'm barely standin'
About to go to pieces, screamin' peace
And though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it
I had my mind full of demons tryin' to break free
They planted seeds and they hatched, sparkin' the flame
Inside my brain like a match, such a dirty game
No memories, just a misery
Paintin' a picture of my enemies killin' me in my sleep
Will I survive 'til the morning to see the sun?
Please Lord, forgive me for my sins, 'cause here I come

Lord! (God!)
I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
God, I lost so many peers

And Lord knows I tried, been a witness to homicide
Seen drive-by's takin' lives, little kids die
Wonder why as I walk by
Broken-hearted as I glance at the chalk line, gettin' high
This ain't the life for me, I wanna change
But ain't no future bright for me, I'm stuck in the game
I'm trapped inside a maze
See this Tanqueray influenced me to gettin' crazy
Disillusioned lately, I've been really wantin' babies
So I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady
Don't trust my lady 'cause she's a product of this poison
I'm hearin' noises, think she's fuckin' all my boys
Can't take no more, I'm fallin' to the floor
Beggin' for the Lord to let me in to Heaven's door
Shed so many tears

Lord, lost so many peers
And shed so many tears
I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears
Lord, I suffered many years
And shed so many tears
God, I lost so many peers

Hahaha, troublesome 19-motherfuckin'-96
(Westside!) Let it be known, nigga!
Boss of all bosses, Makaveli

Menacin' methods, label me a lethal weapon
Makin' niggas die witnessin' breathless imperfections
Can you picture my specific plan?
To be the man in this wicked land, underhanded hits are planned
These scams are plotted over grams and rocks
Outlawz motherfuckers die by the random shots
We all die in the end, so revenge we swore
I was all about my ends; fuck friends and foes!
Me, a born leader, never leave the block without my heater
Got me a dog and named her ""my bitch nigga eater""
What could they do to me, you lil' brat?
Shit, them niggas that shot me is still terrified I'll get they ass
How can I show you how I feel inside?
We Outlawz, motherfuckers can't kill my pride
Niggas talk a lot of shit, but that's after I'm gone
‘Cause they fear me in the physical form

Troublesome nigga, Outlawz
Put it down to the fullest
Spittin' rhymes and bullets, ha ha

Y'all know what time it is
Call the punk police, they can't stop us
Niggas run the streets, we troubleshit

Gutter ways, my mentality is ghetto
We guerrilla in this criminal war, we all rebels
Death before dishonor, bet I bomb on 'em first
Niggas knew we came for murder, pullin' up in a hearse
Westside was the war cry, bustin' off freely
Screamin', ""Fuck all y'all niggas!"" in Swahili
Pistol packin', fresh out of jail, I ain't goin' back
Release me to the care of my heartless strap
Say my name three times like Candyman
Bet I roll on yo' ass, like an avalanche
A sole survivor, learned to get high and pull drive-bys
Murder my foes, can't control my nine
Hearin' thoughts of my enemies pleadin', ""please""
Busta-ass motherfuckers tried to flee
Picture me lettin' this chump survive
Ran up on his ass, when I dumped he died
‘Cause I'm troublesome

Young, strapped, and I don't give a fuck
I'm hopeless
I live the Thug Life, losin' my focus, ba-baby

Bad Boy killa, there is no one realer
What you saw
Was the rough, rugged and raw: Outlaw!

""Murder, murder, my mind state,"" shit ain't changed
Since my last rhyme; the crime rate ain't decline
Niggas bustin' shots like they lost they mind
Like 25 to life never crossed they mind
Tell me young nigga never learned a thang
Dead at thirteen ‘cause he yearned to bang
Sent a lot of flowers, but how could I cry?
Tried to warn the little nigga, ""Either stop or die.""
Mercy is for the weak, when I speak I scream
Afraid to sleep, I'm havin' crazy dreams
Vivid pictures of my enemies, family times
God forgive me ‘cause it's wrong, but I plan to die
Either take me in Heaven and understand I was a G
Did the best I could, raised in insanity
Or send me to Hell, ‘cause I ain't beggin' for my life
Ain't nothin' worse than this cursed-ass hopeless life
I'm troublesome

Believe me
This that new shit I wrote for the true sisters
They said I couldn't say ""bitch"" too much, so I got this new shit for y'all

I Swear I'll never call you bitch again

They gave my homie 90 days for domestic violence
I try to picture myself in this position but remain silent
I get to thinkin' 'bout this shit we been through
We close like kin, but you remain my friend too
This life of sin done got the both of us in trouble
But you always stay down for a nigga, so that's why I love you
Reminiscin' needin' tissues, fightin' over childish issues
Swear I can't live with you; but without you, every day I miss you
When we roll you hold my pistol, my gangsta bitch-itch, you
Always in the mood for love, that's why I'm sleepin' with you
Though not the man of your dreams
My plan and scheme's to be rich like a king
And live my life trouble free, I see
Yesterday I called you names and played games on your mind
I promise that I'll change in time
It's a complicated world, so girl, just be a friend
I swear I'll never call you bitch again
Believe me

Uh, never
I swear I'll never call you bitch again, believe me

I wake up early in the mornin', at the crack of dawn
Nigga still tired so I'm yawnin', and now I'm gone
Tryin' to get my money on strong, so an early riser
Out before them other guys, that's the way to profit every time
Can't get too close, my enemies, they see ghosts, they envy me
Plus we been beefin' with the East Coast, with casualties
Got stopped in traffic, had a warrant, so they gaffled me
But while I'm gone, watch my business and my back for me
My enemies think they got me crossed, they ain't knowin'
Ain't no love for player haters where you cowards goin'
Got me out of jail, paid bail, home again
I promise not to leave you on your own again
Cristal corks are popped, romantic thoughts are dropped
Don't panic but no matter, ‘cause we crossed the top
Told you young lady, you were more than a friend
I swear I'll never call you bitch again, believe me
That's my word

I swear I'll never call you bitch again, believe me

In the same motherfuckin' place at the same motherfuckin' time?

(Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
Break out the champagne glasses and the motherfuckin' condoms
Have one on us, a'ight?
(Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
A toast to the gangsters

Picture perfect, I paint a perfect picture
Bomb the hoochies with precision, my intention's to get richer
With the S-N double-O-P, Dogg, my fuckin' homie
You's a cold-ass nigga on them hogs

Sure 'nough, I keep my hand on my gun
'Cause they got me on the run
Now I'm back in the courtroom, waitin' on the outcome
""Free 2Pac"" is all that's on a nigga's mind
But at the same time, it seems they tryin' to take mine
So I'ma get smart and get defensive and shit
And put together a Million March for some gangsta shit

So now they got us laced
Two multi-millionaire motherfuckers catchin' cases
Bitches get ready for the throw down, the shit's about to go down
Me and Snoop about to clown
I'm losin' my religion, I'm vicious on these stool pigeons
You might be deep in this game, but you got the rules missin'
Niggas be actin' like they savage, they out to get the cabbage
I've got nothin' but love for my niggas livin' lavish

I've got a pit named Petey, she Nigerina
I've got a house out in the hills right next to Chino
And I think I've got a black Bimmer
But my dream is to own a fly casino
Like Bugsy Siegel, and do it all legal
And get scooped up by the little homie in the Regal
It feels good to you, baby-bubba
You see, this is for the G's and the keys, motherfucker

Now follow as we ride
Motherfuck the rest, two of the best from the Westside
And I can make you famous
Niggas been dyin' for years, so how could they blame us?
I live in fear of a felony
I never stop bailin' these motherfuckin' G's
If you got it, better flaunt it
Another warrant, two of America's most wanted

Now give me fifty feet
Defeat is not my destiny, release me to the streets
And keep whatever's left of me
Jealousy is misery, sufferin' is greed
Better be prepared when you cowards fuck with me
I bust and flee, these niggas must be crazy, what?
There ain't no mercy motherfuckers who can't fade the thugs
You thought it was, but it wasn't, now disappear
Bow down in the presence of a boss player

It's like Cuzz, Blood, gang-bangin'
Everybody in the party doin' dope-slangin'
You gotta have papers in this world
You might get your first snatch before your eyes swirl
You doin' your job every day
And then you work so hard 'til your hair turns gray
Let me tell you 'bout life and 'bout the way it is
You see, we live by the gun, so we die by the guns, kids

They tell me not to roll with my Glock
So now I got a throw-away
Floatin' in the black Benz (Bitch), tryin' to do a show a day
They wonder how I live with five shots
Niggas is hard to kill on my block
Schemes for currency and dough-related
Affiliated with the hustlers, so we made it
No answers to questions, I'm tryin' to get up on it
My nigga Dogg wit' me, eternally the most wanted

And pimps be on a mission for them greens

Dressed in Locs and Khaki suits, and ride is what we do
Flossin' but have caution: we collide with other crews
Famous because we throw grams

Bumpin' and grindin' like a slow jam
It's Westside, so you know the Row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say, but give me that bomb beat from Dre

Now you coward cops have got one
And there's no prison that can hold a
Motherfuckin' soldier, ready to roll and take control
So now I jack 'em while they sleepin'
Roll to the door, throw a grenade in the precinct
Some people panic, brothers bugged out
I had to keep poppin' ‘cause there's no stoppin' till they rubbed out
And they vest don't protect from the head wounds
Reload ammunition's and them bitches will be dead soon
Smoke risin' from the barrel of my shotty
I finally got revenge, now count the bodies
Twenty cops, one for every year in jail
Tryna keep a nigga down, but shit fails

Hurry up 'fore she spank shit

If I could recollect before my hood days
I sit and reminisce, thinkin' of bliss and the good days
I stop and stare at the younger
My heart goes to 'em, they tested with stress that they under
And nowadays things change
Everyone's ashamed of the youth 'cause the truth look strange
And for me it's reversed
We left 'em a world that's cursed, and it hurts
‘Cause any day they'll push the button
And all good men like Malcolm X or Bobby Hutton died for nothin'
Don't it make you get teary? The world looks dreary
When you wipe your eyes, see it clearly
There's no need for you to fear me

Maybe you can learn to cheer me

Livin' out of bag but she's glad for the little things she has
And over there, there's a lady, crack got her crazy

I don't trip or let it fade me
From out of the fryin' pan we jump into another form of slavery
Even now I get discouraged
Wonder, if they take it all back, will I still keep the courage?
I refuse to be a role model
I set goals, take control, drink out my own bottles
I make mistakes but learn from every one
And when it's said and done, I bet this brother be a better one
If I upset you, don't stress
Never forget that God isn't finished with me yet
I feel His hand on my brain
When I write rhymes I go blind and let the Lord do his thang
But am I less holy
'Cause I chose to puff a blunt and drink a beer with my homies?

We gotta find peace and end the war in the streets

Rotten Black Cotton in God's eyes
Speak!

Black cotton, steady stressin', Smith & Wessons, count my blessings
Class is in session: the worst question is the first question
Why do we work like slaves sweatin' blades to an early grave?
Never got paid but still we slave (in the nine tre')
Answer that, then answer this too
Love's gonna get ya, you know it's true – life's a bitch, true?
You best to backtrack and try to act black and live
Not to be phony and positive but why be negative?
What's the matter, G? Black cat got your tongue?
Fat track got you sprung, now you're hung?
Do ya feel me? Dum dum diddy, is it me?
Attempt to reach each and every brother on the streets
If not peace, then at least let's get a piece
I'm tired of seein' bodies on the streets deceased
Lookin' through my highschool yearbook
Reminiscin' of the tears as the years took
One homie, two homie, three homies – POOF!
We used to have troops, but now there's no more youth to shoot
God, come save the misbegotten
Lost ghetto souls of Black Cotton (in God's eyes)

Nobody don't care (No matter how hard I try
Look to the sky, and I ask God why)
Nobody don't care (Seems like my dreams
Drowned in by screams, no answer to my questions)
Nobody don't care (Feels like I'm pressed
Why do I stress? It's like I'm bein' tested)
Nobody don't care (Seems like my prayers
Vanished in thin air, please answer my questions)
Nobody don't care

In the belly of the beast I'm bubblin' up
Runnin' out of luck, about to self-destruct
Old heads say live your life like such
You're sure to catch her with your one-day boy
I wouldn't listen to 'em
Your power movement was cool, but it ain't fix nothin'
So I just go with what I know, I don't trust none
Look what the 80's did to us baby kids
And now we grown up, nobody ain't own us yet

Black cotton, I'm plottin' on what they owe me
I'm workin' without a profit, they shacklin' all my homies
I'm hurtin', but keep in mind, it ain't irkin'
And we ain't stop, it's curtains
You try to rise and certainly we survive with Outlaw Ridaz
What's the reward for a struggler?
If the law lovin' us, then why they hate to see us comin' up?
Runnin' up, gun cocked, black mask and gloves
If you ain't got a penny, mind the glove, no love
Waitin' for my 40 acres and a blunt to blaze
Biblical times, good hearts with milita minds
Black Cotton – I'm hoppin' over enemy lines
Black Cotton – I ain't stoppin' till they givin me mine
Black Cotton

Nobody don't care (No matter how hard I try
Look to the sky, and I ask God why)
Nobody don't care (Seems like my dreams
Drowned in by screams, no answer to my questions)
Nobody don't care (Feels like I'm pressed
Why do I stress? It's like I'm bein' tested)
Nobody don't care (Seems like my prayers
Vanished in thin air, please answer my questions)
Nobody don't care"

I got some killas on my payroll, and they know
When it's time to handle business, nigga lay low
Although I'm young, I'm still comin up
I'm gettin paid, pullin raises on niggas when they runnin up
The first to pull a strap when there's drama
Busta, you ain't heard?
I've been slicin motherfuckerss since I lost my momma
There ain't a cop that can stop me

Smack your mother's mamma's mother

How ya like me then, how ya like me, hey-ho, how ya like me now?
Ow, pow, hurt, don't it? Bow, bow, don't run up on it

Poppin after poppin the fools be droppin, the hoes be hoppin
On my thing cause it hangs like the nets from Above the Rim
You lookin grim, is it me or him or him
Or be with me, we be together
So what's up? We can do whatever
Cause real niggas stick together
Till they make it up to heaven
Through the stress, through the hell, through the 1-8-7
The shorter the nigga, the bigga the trigga
The deeper they dig the ditch-a
The Naughty the Treach
Then through to the Pac I brings the Glock I wets up
You fuckin body, I'm like, Oh my Gody
Did I really shoot him? Yo I shot him
So I got him, now I puts the crime behind me
And finds me, a place to lays my head low

See, it ain't easy bein' me
Life as a celebrity is less than heavenly
I got these fakes and these backstabbers chasing me around
And it's always drama, whenever I wanna get around
Momma told me, long before I ever came up
Gotta be true to what you do and keep the game up
‘Cause things change, and jealousy becomes a factor
Best friends at your wife's house, tryin' to mack her
I'm on tour, but still they keep on knockin' at my door
And I got no time to worry, I'm steady wanting more
Every day is a test, yes, I try hard
But I'm strugglin' with every breath, I pray to God
That the woman that I left at home, all alone
There ain't nothing like tryin' to bone, over the phone
In my mind I can see her naked, I can't take it
Got me shaking at the thought that we can make it
I thought you knew

I'm rollin' out on tour today
You getting sad, ‘cause I'm going away
The chickenheads wanna play with me
You getting mad, ‘cause you think I'ma sway
Some of 'em cute, some of 'em fine as fuck
I hear 'em scream soon as I hit the stage, nah...
Still I be getting lonely for you
I'm coming home soon as I make this pay, make this pay

I call you up long distance, on the telephone
Wanna tuck you in even though I can't make it home
I whisper things in your ear like you're near me
Wonder if you feel me from far away, and can you hear me?
It seems to me, that you're jealous
‘Cause I'm hustling and making money with the fellas
In the backstreets, tryin' to track me, baby, hold up!
Thugs get lonely too, but I'm a soldier
And there's no way I'ma stop making money
‘Cause your attitude's changed and you're acting a little funny
Always complaining, saying we don't spend time
Can't you see I got enough stress on my mind?
And hanging up like you all that
Then get mad when I tell you that I'm busy, baby, call back
Please, ain't nothing left to say to you
Thugs get lonely too, you know

I'm rollin' out on tour today
You getting sad, ‘cause I'm going away
The chickenheads wanna play with me
You getting mad, ‘cause you think I'ma sway
Some of 'em cute, some of 'em fine as fuck
I hear 'em scream soon as I hit the stage, nah...
Still I be getting lonely for you
I'm coming home soon as I make this pay, make this pay

I sit alone in my room, drinking without a care
Talking out loud to you, like you're there
Take your picture out my back pocket, man, it's on
You're the first face I wanna see when I get home
Wanna love you 'til the sun rise, buckwild
Touching every wall in the house, thug style
Put your hands on the headboard, think of me
Drippin' sweat on top of you, sink and see
This in your head that I'm making love, so turn the lights down
Reminisce and relax ‘cause, baby, right now
I feel it in the middle of my stomach
You whisper in my ear and baby, tell me how you really want it
Hold on tightly, watch the ceiling
Scratch my back's how you react, let me know you feel me
‘Cause everything I'm giving to you, is so true
And thugs get lonely too, you know

I'm rollin' out on tour today
You getting sad, ‘cause I'm going away

I'm coming home soon as I make this pay, make this pay

Yeah, thug life, baby! Steady thuggin'
Aye, so you remember that
Next time you sweating me when I'm on the road, baby

If you wanna be fake, move on to the next one, that ain't me"

Who's afraid of the punk police?
Niggas run the streets, no justice no peace
Fuck the law, rather draw than do time
Don't fuck with mine, cross the line, my two nines
Go baya baya when I shoot 'em
Korean mothafuckers was crooked
So niggas had to burn and loot 'em
Now the streets ain't safe at night
My Niggas! Straight take his life
So don't sleep when my Jeep creep up, how we hit 'em
Empty the clip, then dip cuz we did 'em
Lickin' of shots for Latasha that's proper
Love for my niggas but a Glock for the coppers
So what the fuck you wanna do now
I packed a .9 last year, in '99 I'm packin' 2 now
And even if they pull their triggers
They can shoot one man
But nothings gonna stop the plan of true niggas

Niggas! (Yeah niggas, you can't fuck with us)
Niggas! (Cuz bein' a nigga means you love niggas)
Niggas!
(Jada!, ey yo)

My dimes make the fiends go to sleep, so they call 'em bedrocks
Niggas is like photographers, all they take is head shots
Your last words'll be, ""damn what's all these red dots?""
Niggas nowawadays, they worry me, my bars is therapy
As long as you usin' them thouroughly
Muah til the day that they bury me
My niggas is stronger and tighter now than they probably will ever be
And i'm a product of the '70's
The hood got niggas on punishment, that's why they never leave
If I ain't eatin' with you, i'm probably beefin' with you
If no money ain't involved ain't no need for me speakin' with you
I know you got a gun but i'm hopin' you keep it with you
Cuz unfortunately, i'm one of them rappers that keep a pistol and
You know what the llama do, Shady/Aftermath
Ruff Ryders, D-Block, and of course Amaru
Lotta people honor you
Probably cuz of the way you used to bring the drama to
Whoever you wanted to
You a leader when you can get a leader to follow you
But anyway, life goes on
So i'll see you when I art in heaven like our fathers do

I'm still wicked in my ways, a hustler 'til my dying days
Ain't nuttin wrong with gettin paid, so nigga blaze
Cause we some motherfuckin fools
Walkin through the streets wearing jewels, breakin niggas makin moves
Even the cops can't stop us, my enemies flip
When they see me drink a fifth of that Hennessy

They wanna knows my role model, it's in a brown bottle
(Yo what's our motherfuckin motto nigga?)

(That's what I'm sippin on, now let me tell 'em who I be)
Big ballin' ass nigga named Trice

Now I was born in Detroit on the side that's West
Troubled child comin up I had to ride I guess
Tried to apply myself, them niggas was ballin
My mama couldn't tell me shit, the streets was callin
I was often involved with niggas breakin the law
I look back, 'Pac nigga, we was bankin off raw
P-Funk got it pumpin, he had the connects
Threw the sack to his lil' niggas workin the set
And if you got it you gettin wet, nigga bet on that
Don't come around hurr on that floss shit
Detroit niggas off shit
(Robbin niggas in the do'ways) That's right
(With my four-four, that's the sure way)
And this your road days, All Eyez on Me
We was looney I suppose, you could (die homie)
O. Trice always rep his block
Pass the Henn and that ice
I'm on a track with 'Pac nigga

They wanna knows my role model, it's in a brown bottle
(Yo what's our motherfuckin motto nigga?)
Hennessy
They wanna knows my role model, it's in a brown bottle

Can't you read the signs?

Mobbin' like a motherfucker, stuck
Can you picture a middle finger out the window, gettin' fucked
Off liquor; get loaded, can't control it
Nigga, pass me the blunt and let me roll it
You get the bozack to the ho-stack, that's for sho', black
So be a mack and keep your dough fat
And tell me, what does it take to be a G?
I started with a quarter ounce, soon bounced to a ki'
You gotta watch your back, stay strapped, be alert
Started as a young motherfucker doin' dirt
And now I'm in the rap game, like the crack game, I got enemies
Can't pretend to see my friends are not my enemies
And even thug motherfuckers wanna have fun
Stuck in, buckin' my motherfuckin' Magnum
What does it take to be a G?
Silence is a must, violence is a plus
Bust shots at my adversaries, them niggas scurry
Pick a spot to be buried, ‘cause I'll be buckin' in a fuckin' hurry

Thug for life, high 'til I die
When them stupid-ass bitches ask why, tell 'em
Shootin' crooked ass cops, let me fry
Do or die, to my brothers in the penitentiary
Raise hell, when them niggas mention me

When them stupid-ass bitches ask why, tell 'em
Thug for life, high 'til I die

Game thicker than most of these tricks
I got my mind on makin' money
But you stuck on these fake bitches
And jealous motherfuckers can't see
That's it's the fame that causes
These stupid bitches to pass the pussy free
So tell me, why you sweat a motherfucker like me?
A young nigga tryin' to hustle up some G's
You pussy-ass playa hatin' hoes
Freakin' down on niggas, jumpin' around at the shows
And you the first motherfucker to jump
To the trunk when it's time for funk, little trick-ass punk
Thug motherfuckers don't die
We get high and we multiply, motherfucker
Give a holla to my niggas in the Bay
I'm livin' in L.A., still clutchin' on my AK

Thug for life, high 'til I die
When them stupid-ass bitches ask why, tell 'em
Shootin' crooked ass cops, let me fry
Do or die, to my brothers in the penitentiary
Raise hell, when them niggas mention me
Thug for life, high 'til I die

Baby, I'm in denial or I feel entitled

Too many times I let these side hoes
Leave me burning like Michael by the pyro
Or the chick in Diddy's hot tub
And that'll get you locked up
Duh
Because the chick on my arm is a ticking time bomb
So the dick in my charm, it don't fit in my palm
Plus that last trip to the Palms
Made her sold them tickets to her moms
???????
Cause they don't know a ""sira"" or an ""ire"" in the Koran
So she wonder what's allowed in her RAM
While I'm singing George Michael in Wham
Wake me up before you go-go before you go-go
And trick off of Ray Bans
And her next tan, with some clear water and some fresh sand
The next man would've reneged on the deal
But luckily for her she got somebody's that's real

She used to seeing her dude as much as Hollow Man
And he just jet on his son with no hologram
I got a great record with girls that be modeling
And you ain't even touching that nigga, that's that Serato fam
She seen me on the TV more than need be
Trying to see the World, I'm already Mr. Feeny
Next door to your girl, bell ringing
Shit, I would never see them double D's in 3D
So how could you, put an X next to X like Malcolm do?
Told her, ""Let me love you like Mario. Fuck Bowser boo.""
She said, ""Your name is 15 so can I count on you?""
""Pppst. More than once baby. Whenever you want lady.""
You can feel me or just IPod Touch play me
That nigga fucking crazy, so you should fuck me crazy
She said, ""Great idea.""
She'd been looking for the real and it stays right here
I'm like

Could be the price of hate
What am I guilty of
Why do you make me wait
So long I don't know your intentions
Look to the sky's above
I'm in the hands of fate
Push 'til it gets to shove
I've got to know for heavens sake
Is this love or invention?
Baby can't you see I'll find another fantasy
You hang around with people who are sure to make you cry
I can make you happy if only for a while
Little baby oh, oh little baby
I can give you all the lovin' that your heart desires
If you ain't got time for me I'll find another fantasy
You take someone's heart
And you kick it around
Keep on picking it up
So you can watch it come down
I don't know what I am suppose to do
While I wait for you to make up your mind
Could you please be so kind
When you know what to do, I'll be in the next room
But if you leave here too late, I may be in the next state
Hmm..."

Baby, I'm in denial or I feel entitled
To the truth like when Chloe yelled ""Bible""
Too many times I let these side hoes
Leave me burning like Michael by the pyro
Or the chick in Diddy's hot tub
And that'll get you locked up
Duh
Because the chick on my arm is a ticking time bomb
So the dick in my charm, it don't fit in my palm
Plus that last trip to the Palms
Made her sold them tickets to her moms
???????
Cause they don't know a ""sira"" or an ""ire"" in the Koran
So she wonder what's allowed in her RAM
While I'm singing George Michael in Wham
Wake me up before you go-go before you go-go
And trick off of Ray Bans
And her next tan, with some clear water and some fresh sand
The next man would've reneged on the deal
But luckily for her she got somebody's that's real
:
Holla at somebody real
Holla at somebody real
Before they holla at you
And you see them in the club popping collars at you
Holla at somebody real
Holla at somebody real
Before they holla at you
And the next thing you know they throwing dollars at you
 :
She used to seeing her dude as much as Hollow Man
And he just jet on his son with no hologram
I got a great record with girls that be modeling
And you ain't even touching that nigga, that's that Serato fam
She seen me on the TV more than need be
Trying to see the World, I'm already Mr. Feeny
Next door to your girl, bell ringing
Shit, I would never see them double D's in 3D
So how could you, put an X next to X like Malcolm do?
Told her, ""Let me love you like Mario. Fuck Bowser boo.""
She said, ""Your name is 15 so can I count on you?""
""Pppst. More than once baby. Whenever you want lady.""
You can feel me or just IPod Touch play me
That nigga fucking crazy, so you should fuck me crazy
She said, ""Great idea.""
She'd been looking for the real and it stays right here
I'm like

Holla at somebody real

Has been a real good friend of mine
Waiting for that change of season
Oh the winter's been so long
Searching for that rhyme or reason
You've just got to
Move on
Hold it together, move on
Life's so short, move on
Only time can set you free
You put your fears behind you
Better get yourself where you wanna be
I think of all the days and night that I spent crying
And I move on
I've been in and out of favour with love
Because I gotta tell ya
I've been things I never wanted to be
And then some angel called me up
Told me I was sleeping
Don't waste time
Coz even angels say goodbye
Waiting for that change of season
Oh the winter's been so long

You've just got to
Move on
Hold it together, move on

You put your tears behind you
Better get yourself where you wanna be
I think of all the days and night that I spent crying
Endlessly
And oh, there goes another season
Getting hard to find a decent song to play
But oh, I guess I got my reasons
Everybody thinks I'm doing AOK
They ought to know by now
Move on
Hold it together, move on
Life's so short, move on
Only time can set you free
You put your tears behind you
Better get yourself where you wanna be

Until my angel set me free
I'm gonna be lucky in love someday"

These are the days of the open hand
They will not be the last
Look around now
These are the days of the beggars and the choosers
This is the year of the hungry man
Whose place is in the past
Hand in hand with ignorance
And legitimate excuses
The rich declare themselves poor
And most of us are not sure
If we have too much
But we'll taking our chance to say
I sang twenty years and a day
But nothing changed
The human race found some other guy
And walked into the flame
It's hard to love, there's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope
When there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above say it's much too late
Then maybe we should all be praying for time
Doo oh oh
Do you think we have time?
Do you
Do you think we have time?
These are the days of the empty hand
Oh, you hold on to what you can
And charity, charity is a coat you wear twice a year
This is the year of the guilty man
Your television takes a stand
And you find that what was over there is over here
So you scream from behind your door
Say what's mine is mine and not yours
I may have too much but I'll take my chances
I sang twenty years and a day
'Cause nothing changed
The human race found some other guy
And walked into the flames
It's hard to love, Jesus, there's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope, there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above say it's much too late
Then maybe we should all be praying for time

How can it be good enough for two?

First impression when you met me might have thought I was a weird one
You were right, here's proof, straight into your eardrums
I don't spit raps, my saliva's pure acid
It only ever burns my throat and leaves my breath raspin'
Ask me one more time if I can bust some fuckin' rhymes
I'll throw you off a bridge and watch the bubbles rise
I ain't down to rhyme with no stupid MCs
I just load up my tech 9 and start shootin' them freaks
Trained in the brain you can't mess with my psyche
I'm runnin' the block, like a Lego wearin' Nikes
Even if you don't like me, admit I spit so rightly
I stand six feet tall, none of y'all can fight me
Seriously though, I do this shit so easily
For many other MCs, this ain't feasibly
Possible, obstacle after obstacle
Set up in front of me I eat 'em up like a pasta bowl
Complete with matzo balls, I'm unstoppable
You can't say shit about how ""Asians ain't rhymers""
Forgot about our haikus like y'all had alzheimers
What I'm doing now, it's just a hobby on the side
But I still eat y'all like sushi with wasabi on the side
Wash it down with some sake
You're never gonna block me
You could be at Kinko's and still couldn't copy
My flow so dope that I got you all listening
Even though I wrote this stupid verse when I was 15
Immature kid, I had a bigger head
But older white women said I'm very articulate
Up in Eugene, in between, watchin' Scooby Doo
I had a feeling I was kinda unusual
Never any Asians in my neighborhood
And if there were, I bet none of them would stay for good
It was all white people and a few from Mexico
Like my best friend Brian. He's next to go!
And he's got big testicles! Briaaan!
(Brian Steveson):
Let me take you to a world that's devoid of mediocrity
My words are so wise that you would think I'm reading Socrates
Aristotle, full throttle, Charlie's Angels sequel
But hear my rhymes out; they are anything but fecal
So great, overweight, gotta keep it bright and shiny
Colgate, don't hate or else you can kiss my hiney
Yeah I said ""hiney,"" you can laugh, Brick Tamland
Now look into my mind, open it up like a SPAM can
Fresh outta Mickey D's, put down the Big Mac
Now I've got the time to lay down all these sick raps
Man I'm not rich, but it doesn't mean I'm sad about it
Cause through my life I've had happiness in vast amounts and
Just because you graduated with the highest honors
Doesn't justify that I am any less of a scholar
You think you're smarter than me, think you'll go farther than me
Just because in high school science class was harder for me?
Well you're wrong so cut it out, I don't need to hear your cheap attack
I'll ignore all your rumours; I'll save that for Fleetwood Mac
I go my own way, cause my dreams don't stop
And I'll live life dubstep when I let the bass drop
Where the real madness starts and I resume with more intensity
Working hard at things, it just makes a lot more sense to me
Until that day comes, I will work my most fun job
Sitting on my butt all day and watching tons of Spongebob
I still love the things that I did in my youth
And I'm way more awkward than George Michael Bluth
So many great things that I wish I could acknowledge
And half of them happened in my freshman year of college
In more sticky situations than if you were in a taffy truck
A looney U of O student, that makes me a daffy duck
It's time for me to go now, I've got other crap to do
But it's been a real pleasure that you let me rap 2 u
Hook:
You, we're rapping to you my friend and only you
To you! So don't ever say we never did nothing for you
(Lakutis):
Sexy Lexi, ask what the address be
Press be makin' a face, Dizzy Gillespie
Applause, pause, hand me my ESPY
Grammy, I'm Leslie Nielsen, you know I'm chillin'
Float like a butterfly come my sugar baby
On my shoulders, 7 million, sugar babies
Float away on my good looks and charm
(Gradient):
But good looks and charm only get you so far
When you never work hard
But you think you'll be a star
And you say that you're a rapper but you never spit a bar
You say you got drive but you're never in the car
Everyone is just a pebble in the jar, man
Come on, search for me, Carmen
San Diego like Ron Burgundy
Panda birth
Y'all stay classy, planet Earth"

They will not be the last
Look around now
These are the days of the beggars and the choosers

Whose place is in the past
Hand in hand with ignorance
And legitimate excuses
The rich declare themselves poor
And most of us are not sure
If we have too much
But we'll taking our chance to say
I sang twenty years and a day
But nothing changed
The human race found some other guy
And walked into the flame
It's hard to love, there's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope
When there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above say it's much too late
Then maybe we should all be praying for time
Doo oh oh
Do you think we have time?
Do you
Do you think we have time?
These are the days of the empty hand
Oh, you hold on to what you can
And charity, charity is a coat you wear twice a year
This is the year of the guilty man
Your television takes a stand
And you find that what was over there is over here
So you scream from behind your door
Say what's mine is mine and not yours
I may have too much but I'll take my chances
I sang twenty years and a day
'Cause nothing changed
The human race found some other guy
And walked into the flames
It's hard to love, Jesus, there's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope, there is no hope to speak of

Would you have to let me go?
Could you listen to your heart
If your head stopped to think twice?
If you knew every woman
And I knew every man
We never would have made it past holding hands
I guess the saying is no longer true
And what you don't know can hurt you
I guess there's just no question, baby
You know what you're doing in bed
If I want your touch
Should I know too much
Some things are better left unsaid
So do I really want to know?
(Do I really want to know?)
Do I really want to know your life?
(Have to know your life)
Would I have to let you go?
Could I listen to my heart
If my head stopped to think twice?
Tell me baby
Said it's one thing to guess
And one thing to know
And don't you think that maybe baby I've got secrets of my own?
If I knew every woman
And you knew every man
We never would have made it past holding hands
I used to say it but it's no longer true
'cause what you don't know can really hurt you
It can kill you, baby
And even as we speak
The world is full of lovers
Night after night
And week after week
Trusting to luck
And their pockets full of rubbers"

Hitching a ride
Could be a woman or a man
Gonna get what you want before too long
Gonna take your opportunities
Right or wrong
Some poor cow with a seven-year itch?
You don't dig men
But you'll fuck' em if they're rich
You can't be with me

These are the days of the beggars and the choosers

Whose place is in the past
Hand in hand with ignorance
And legitimate excuses
The rich declare themselves poor
And most of us are not sure
If we have too much
But we'll taking our chance to say
I sang twenty years and a day
But nothing changed
The human race found some other guy
And walked into the flame
It's hard to love, there's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope
When there is no hope to speak of
And the wounded skies above say it's much too late
Then maybe we should all be praying for time

Oh, you hold on to what you can
And charity, charity is a coat you wear twice a year
This is the year of the guilty man
Your television takes a stand
And you find that what was over there is over here
So you scream from behind your door
Say what's mine is mine and not yours
I may have too much but I'll take my chances
I sang twenty years and a day
'Cause nothing changed
The human race found some other guy
And walked into the flames
It's hard to love, Jesus, there's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope, there is no hope to speak of

""You want my family, for your liberty, I can't do that.""

Whether they be amber, green or blue
There's a piece of God staring back at you

They see our broken women

""I've been awake about a week
I'm thinking about asking the doctor
If he could put me back to sleep""
Then he laughed and said
""Hey all the girls they look the same""
Don't they know just what their mothers
Paid in blood, and tears to change
But the words that made me cry

It stayed with me, it keeps messing with my head
He said, ""If Jesus Christ is alive and well
Then how come John & Elvis are dead?""
Youth, beautiful youth
We walked through the walls until we found the truth
And said ""Change it, it's ugly just change it""
Everyone we used to know
Must have given up, so long ago
You can see it, it's written on their faces
And the inside of their clothes

Into the arms of something better

Waiting patiently to make my mark

Two little Hitlers in an old church hall
Some cheesy covers and those neighbours that banged on the walls

Please sir you would not understand

Said I don't know why that is

Precious keeps me company on
Keeps me from being alone
Because no one comes in the morning
And no one comes in the evening time
I'd sit and wait for the phone to ring
I could be waiting my whole damn life
So sick of the same old faces
In this street where nobody talks to me
And the funny side of the situation is
I don't care
I'll always be there
When you come down from the sky
And make yourself at home
In my house
Baby
'Cause these days it's the money, the money
The money, honey, or your life
I said, don't you know you can't have both?
I said, don't you know you can't have both?
I said, don't you know you can't have both?
Stop acting so dumb
The moment will come
I will find someone like you

But now we meet to take him flowers
And only God knows why
For what's the use in pressing palms

We've so much to loose
And what we have to learn we rarely choose
So if it's God who took her son
He cannot be the one living in her mind

Don't think that God is dead
Take care my love, she said
You have been loved
If I was weak, forgive me
But I was terrified
You brushed my eyes with angels wings, full of love
The kind that makes devils cry
So these days
My life has changed
And I'll be fine
But she just sits and counts the hours
Searching for her crime
So what's the use of pressing palms
If you won't keep such love from harm
It's a cruel world
You've so much to prove
And heaven helps the ones who wait for you
Well I've no daughters, I've no sons

I'm 'bout to takeoff, I gave 'em a chance
They gave me ten M&M's on advance
Thought I'd be trappin' forever, but God came and blessed me
I guess it was part of the plan
How he on fire, but he cool as a fan?
Can't get at you, we gon' get at your man
They can relate to me 'cause I be poppin' it
Put in they face, let 'em see what I'm sayin'
I'm rockin' shows like I play with a band
Free all the bros, know I would if I can
If I don't mean it, I swear I ain't sayin' it
'Fore I was 21, swear I was savage, smashin'

Hold up, who got Backwoods? I need roll up
Dior store can't keep up with me
I'm spendin' thousands like money is nothin' to me
I'm never comin' back, them people under me
Not the fans, yeah, the haters
Lotta bands on the table
They say I went commercial, I ain't know it
They want me catch a murder, I ain't goin' back
Play myself and my position, who doin' that?

We got FN with extensions, we throwin' that
Her ass got my full attention, she throwin' that
Niggas talkin' way too much, I ain't goin' back
And forth with niggas 'cause these niggas be holdin' racks
On the real, yeah, we know you don't own them racks
Four pockets full, push 'em down, they start pokin' back
I turned eight million right until I'm a quarterback
Spent a million like I'm tryna bring Kobe back (24, woo)
I'm ready, I'm ready, I use the crockpot like it's Betty
They say the drop hot and it's ready
Might stretch it out, but it ain't fetti (Yes)
Say my dawg doin' time
But I know he ain't gonna snitch 'cause it's still some shit he didn't tell me
My dawg stabbed his celly
He told me the whole story over the celly (Brr, hello?)
Went up on my price, in my pocket like Kelly
Fucked her in the telly, no I can't not say who, no telly
My head gettin' heavy
And you know I still got Balmains on my ass (Woo)
No, I can't do no Amiris
Said I'm takin' trips, long flights, they scary
She said her birthday in March, okay, cool, so that means you an Aries
I told her, ""Gotta go,"" she said, ""You serious?""
Diamonds cold as December, my vibe Sagittarius

Hold up, who got Backwoods? I need roll up (Haha, period, period, slatt, woo)
Dior store can't keep up with me
I'm spendin' thousands like money is nothin' to me
I'm never comin' back, them people under me

Lotta bands on the table
They say I went commercial, I ain't know it
They want me catch a murder, I ain't goin' back
Play myself and my position, who doin' that?

I can switch up and come back another way
If the vibe ain't right, come back another day
Biggest dripper, I start up a tidal wave
Remix weed, we put it in a microwave
Batch for twenty-three like I know Michael J
He can say what he want, but he gotta pay
Used to hide all the guns where my mama stay
Sell my drugs 'round the corner
I pay all these bills, I'm a grownup
My cars a lil' different, I own 'em
I ain't with no leasin', my bitch tellin' me I need credit
It's loud and clear if I said it
I come from the gutter, I spent me a hundred on Chevys
You can take me out the hood, but you can't take the hood out of me
Know the hood proud of me
I Givenchyed my tee, went and upgrade my teeth
Yeah, I dropped out of school, but that paper on me

Hold up, who got Backwoods? I need roll up
Dior store can't keep up with me
I'm spendin' thousands like money is nothin' to me
I'm never comin' back, them people under me
Not the fans, yeah, the haters

Don't know how to feel, I got some feelings that I can't explain
Yeah

Clothes busted, nose dusty, watch the older bros hustlin'
Started off wrong, but you couldn't tell me I ain't know nothin'
All I ever want was to put on and give my folks somethin'
Knockin' on my sister window, comin' in at 4 somethin'
Mama trippin' 'bout the way I'm livin' and how my hoes comin' (In and out)
Caught the next-door neighbor slippin', we slimed him, left his nose runnin' (In his house)
Knowin' I can't lie, so when she asked me, I  make no comment
Terrorizin', thuggin', doin' dumb shit, makin' no money
It was time for me to go up, got a pack and made it blow up
Went into that corner store until I got it all
Know I skipped a couple parts, but I can't never tell 'em all
But the moral of the story, I got it all out the mud
The way karma make me feel, I swear I think I'm in love
Been fuckin' strippers since I was lil', fell in love with the club
Bruh gave me everything I need, knew what to say to the plug
I got my hands on a few mil', but shit, it still ain't enough
It's like my life is like a dream, but I'm still here when I wake
I'm gon' get everything I need, I'll do whatever it take
I caught a case, ran, got away, I should've jumped in the lake
I thought about it the other day when I slid through in the Wraith

Damn, my life's changed, check my ice game
Came from standin' in the rain to top floor gettin' brain
Still actin' the same, I walk in, they know my name
Don't know how to feel, I got some feelings that I can't explain

Bad bitch, we both young
They say that I'm cheatin' and we both dumb
But Baby got her wrist hittin', both arms
G-Wagen and Range Rover, both of 'em
If we love forever, you get new homes
I just wish that other **** could move on
She proud to be rockin' that new two-tone
My life goin' good, why would I do wrong?
I'm livin' my best just like Lil Duval
I didn't get the message, and it's screw y'all
I don't want no issues, can't be beefin' with my family
I don't want no problems, just make sure my kids can count and read
And it ain't no pressure 'bout the money, I won't even see it
It's bigger, it's the principle, I hope one day that you can see
We got a whole seed to raise, it's bigger than you and me
How I'm not gon' do that? I spend millions on my jewelry
The only reason I'm mentionin' it is 'cause I'm tired of this foolery
I'm just emptying my thoughts, I can't keep 'em in a box
Ain't no hard feelings at all, I want everyone to ball

If you ever run into police, you better not tell
Turn it up, I might as well, you know I'm so 4PF
'Fore I go, I gotta say what's up to all the bros in jail

And his lawyer cost one-sixty, I hope they un-convict him when he go back
Follow him with a low jack, then step on him like a doormat

I just came back from the West with a trophy
I'm on some more shit

Yeah

Clothes busted, nose dusty, watch the older bros hustlin'
Started off wrong, but you couldn't tell me I ain't know nothin'
All I ever want was to put on and give my folks somethin'
Knockin' on my sister window, comin' in at 4 somethin'
Mama trippin' 'bout the way I'm livin' and how my hoes comin' (In and out)
Caught the next-door neighbor slippin', we slimed him, left his nose runnin' (In his house)
Knowin' I can't lie, so when she asked me, I  make no comment
Terrorizin', thuggin', doin' dumb shit, makin' no money
It was time for me to go up, got a pack and made it blow up
Went into that corner store until I got it all
Know I skipped a couple parts, but I can't never tell 'em all
But the moral of the story, I got it all out the mud
The way karma make me feel, I swear I think I'm in love
Been fuckin' strippers since I was lil', fell in love with the club
Bruh gave me everything I need, knew what to say to the plug
I got my hands on a few mil', but shit, it still ain't enough
It's like my life is like a dream, but I'm still here when I wake
I'm gon' get everything I need, I'll do whatever it take
I caught a case, ran, got away, I should've jumped in the lake
I thought about it the other day when I slid through in the Wraith

Damn, my life's changed, check my ice game
Came from standin' in the rain to top floor gettin' brain
Still actin' the same, I walk in, they know my name

G-Wagen and Range Rover, both of 'em
If we love forever, you get new homes
I just wish that other **** could move on
She proud to be rockin' that new two-tone
My life goin' good, why would I do wrong?
I'm livin' my best just like Lil Duval
I didn't get the message, and it's screw y'all
I don't want no issues, can't be beefin' with my family
I don't want no problems, just make sure my kids can count and read
And it ain't no pressure 'bout the money, I won't even see it
It's bigger, it's the principle, I hope one day that you can see
We got a whole seed to raise, it's bigger than you and me
How I'm not gon' do that? I spend millions on my jewelry
The only reason I'm mentionin' it is 'cause I'm tired of this foolery
I'm just emptying my thoughts, I can't keep 'em in a box
Ain't no hard feelings at all, I want everyone to ball

Kick me when I'm down, when I get up, I'll prolly shit on you
I can't even lie, I'll prolly see 'em, I just spit on them
These pieces I got lit on me, this piece I got gon' hit on men
I ain't ever did no fraud, but I'm known for pullin' cards
Ask about me in my neighborhood, I'm known for goin' hard
I've been bustin' on that glizzy ever since I had got robbed (Bah-bah, bah-bah)

I know real trappers that stay on the block, but they don't play lines
But if they see 12, they know to run, though, like they Rajon
I stack that shit up to the ceiling, no more sharin' clothes
I bought a pendant, came from Watson, but I ain't proposed
Ridin' with an AR, but he got murked with a revolver
I sent the crackhead in the pharmacy for cough syrup
No, she can't play me, but if she try, I'ma dog her
They been askin' questions crazy, ""Is you 'bout to drop a tape yet?""
""Is you tryna go independent? Rylo did you sign with Baby?""

I buy Dolce Gabbana, Chanel a month straight
Supermodel, her body gon' be my entree
I been runnin' with hitters, my youngins gun slang
Cars up to date, brand new Wraith
My life circle, mines ain't straight
Bills ain't late, paid no notes
I ain't no joke, they want smoke
We exotic, start a riot, we gon' ride

Glock-19 unfold and it spit out
Double R underneath the door when I get out

How the fuck your whole gang down the road and you still out?
Undercover rat, pussy nigga, you a sellout
Every show I get either packed or it sell out
I been ballin' hard, you on the bench, you gotta sit out

I was too gone, now a nigga just pop shit
I was in Japan, buyin' drip and blowin' yen

Call overseas, tell them youngins to spin again
I don't throw rocks and hide my hand 'cause I'm a man
Million cash in the book bag, I'm a big dog
Threw my shot at any nigga, bitch, I think I'm Chris Paul

Got your vibe all on my drip, she say you cheap
And she know I'm havin' money, buy her titties, ass, and teeth
Catchin' three flights every day, the only time I get some sleep
Kept it real and they be cappin', really you can't compete
I spend it all on bullets, niggas don't wanna beef
Got a D-boy swag, pull up SRT
I ain't playin' with nobody, nobody gon' play with me
Got a driver for my car, he take me from A to Z
Got some homies on the yard I probably'll never see
If the money was the issue I promise they'd be free
They was sleepin' on me bad, they fucked around, woke up a beast
Switch it up, I went romantic, took my shawty out to Greece
Every city that I go to, gotta link up with the street
I'm too humble for 'em, guess that's why they thinkin' I was sweet

Niggas having undercover pressure 'bout bitches
Let a nigga know if it’s smoke

I was sittin' in jail, I was in penitentiary
I done seen the gangsta niggas turn bitches
I'ma answer calls, I don’t like bitches
She'll still pull up on a nigga and kick it
I ain't gon' lie, we talked about this
I always knew that I would be rich
Shawty, she cry like I'm buyin' tears
She done kept it gangsta all these years
Used to write the bitch, she ain't write back
Now I'm on top, she don’t like that
I don’t think about it, had to let 'em know that
She can die tomorrow, I prolly wouldn’t notice
Try to hold me down, I gotta stay focused
Go and get the money, bust the safe open
Stay away from broads, I gotta stay low
Rest in peace my dawg, he got a halo (Yeah)

Play with me, you gon' get chastised
Free the bros down the road doin' real time
All the homies, they call it the red line
He gon' only pull up when they say it’s time
Play with me, you gon' get chastised
Free the bros down the road doin' real time
All the homies, they call it the red line
He gon' only pull up when they say it's time

Ain't got no patience for bullshit
I kill 'em all dead, ain't gone play with nobody
Lil' homie thuggin', he 13
Like a slim bitch, he just want him a body
No one went to the league, but we all ball
Make sure everyone eat, I don't ball hog
Swear it's somethin' 'bout the hood that make my heart beat
Do a show and fly right back to spark street
Been dead broke, that's what scarred me
Watchin' niggas hustle, that's what taught me
They was tryna leave me by the garbage
Now they callin', ""Meet me, I'm a target""
Do it for 'em, make 'em feel important
Knowin' damn well I should've ignored it
I buy what I want, I can afford it
Lot of money, I want more of it

Play with me, you gon' get chastised
Free the bros down the road doin' real time

Trappin' by the roadblock
I only give until my legs out
Been a real nigga 'til my legs stop
Real trapper, my legs tired
Real trapper, my legs tired
Yeah, yeah

My life was hard, it just had to be (Yeah)
Watch me turn my dreams to reality (Yeah)
I'm runnin' outfield, them demons after me (Yeah)
When I pop these Percs, I don't do it happily
Got a little fame, all of a sudden they change
Feel like shovel with dirt thrown side of my name
I was so blind, I just couldn't see the hate
Forgave all them niggas, I'm still Ray

Would have never started rappin' if I knew this shit had came with this
If I had never made a hit, would they be on my dick?
I just been sittin' back and pushin' pounds, just gettin' fit
And I got a 60 on my right wrist, I'm movin' fast like lightnin'
These other rappers tryna bite me, your baby mama wanna bite me
I swear to God she triflin', I pass her on 'cause I'm righteous
I run the jungle like Tarzan, that codeine was like poison
I cut back, I feel awesome, no playoffs but I'm ballin'
Had a good day, I scored 40 and I ain't talkin' points
I close my eyes, I still have flashbacks when I was in the joint
I hit my knees, I'm thankin' God, I'm prayin' every mornin'
I check the schedule and I'm booked up, I'm finally tourin'
I'm goin' where I wanna go, doin' what I wanna do
I can screw who I wanna screw, I came from nothin', I can never lose
Turned my dreams into reality, I thought that you'd be glad for me
I can't believe that you mad at me, damn, dawg, I'm proud of you
My life was garbage, too, but I did what I 'posed to do
And I went and bought the latest coupe, told my young nigga stay in school
But he ain't listen, now he got a .45 in the kitchen with a biscuit ready to flip it

My life was hard, it just had to be (Had to be)
Watch me turn my dreams to reality (Reality)

The way my nigga crossed me up, I thought his name was Chris
Don't wanna fuck around and kill my dawg, they gon' do me like I'm Vick
Yeah, they gon' really hate me if I sign a deal
I'ma go buy a Wraith, crash it on purpose, blame it on the pills
When Lil' Joe be slidin', it be look like he headed to second base
I see the hate, it look like makeup, it's all on their face
I can't see Fred no more so I be talkin' to his headstone
Sometimes I wanna catch a body, but I put my head on
Crawford finna touch down, he in the red zone
I sure got tired of sendin' him naked pictures of my red bone
Yeah, G just bounced right back off a headshot
Yeah, I won't fuck that bitch if she ain't got no ass shots
Put them choppers on the jet, we gon' air it out
25 hundred on some trap gear, we gon weigh it out
Too much dirty money, won't put that shit in the shower
Even when lights out, boy, that money still bring power
Can't serve a lot of white, but that shit look like baby powder
Got my gun at every show, I don't care if it ain't crowded
I barely sleep, but when I do, I just be dreamin'
They know I came from the bottom like bikinis
When I can't get hold to them Percs, I be fiendin'
Why would you tell me that you love me and you don't mean it?

My life was hard, it just had to be (Yeah)

Run that back, Turbo

You niggas bogus, I see the imposers
I used to sell yola, trap on Motorolla
Spittin' these vocals, labels think I wrote it
Slippery wet paints, the coupes are candy-coated
Just left the bank, I need a bag to hold this
The streets like a farm 'cause all we ride is horses
Let my face tell it, we done made a fortune
I'm ridin' with my dawg and he ain't gotta question

I got a bitch like Keisha off of Belly
Police got dogs and they can't even smell me
Keep me a cup, I got a lean belly
20s on me, I call 'em green relish
Balmain my jeans, if not, they embellished
Too many vibes, they think I'm R. Kelly
PH in the sky, we got 'em already
PJ in the sky and I don't wanna land it
Creepin' at night, the VLONE bandit
I prayed to the sky and none of this was handed
Worked all my life and now I understand it
Crawled up like a mouse, but I could never tell it
I got the sweetest sauce like jelly
Try disrespect me, you all get beheaded
I got the drip, they call me Dripavelli
I held him down, that nigga was my celly
Fuck you fuck niggas, devil made me heartless
Thank God, came and got me, used to shop at Target
They cut out the coupe before we hit the market
We don't pack our bags 'cause we gon' shop regardless
Backend, I'm back in, paid up for the party
I done came a long way from openin' up for Carti
Shades and my bracelets Cartier Carti
Police's cases, all that we avoidin'
The lean in my cup gettin' more and more muddy
I shown all my love, I've never been a bully
Got every color VLONE hoodie
Just jumped in the game and still I ain't no rookie
I got this sauce, cream and puddin'
I came with the drip, got everybody lookin'
Cherish your blessings, easily could be tooken
Send a front in, it's easy to get a book in

Yeah, cash all my backends, I bought me a Patek
Addicted to cabbage, the money relax me
My mom and them happy, I bought them a mansion
I still rock the fitted, but I don't be cappin' (Skrrt)
These camouflage denim like I just went campin'
They still can't believe that I made it, they happy
I been gettin' money before I was rappin'
I'm ridin' in the Wraith like I play with the actors
No pleadin', arraignment, ain't takin' no charges
My young nigga's solid, I know that he got me
He keep his mouth closed, I'ma buy him a foreign
Penthouse, hotel suite whenever we're tourin'
How foreign my tint is, I still rock the Jordan
Packin' out shows, love my fans, they important
And I'm still in the trap, in the hood like a motor
Spend thousands on fragrance, she fuckin' my odor
I just started rappin', I made me some millions
Man, shout out Atlanta, I'm runnin' my city
These bracelets came healthy, they cost me a 50
I leveled it up, I've been handlin' business
Gettin' 20 a night, every day, different city
I just keep puttin' this syrup in my kidneys
This the big one, boy, this not the Jubilee (Jubilee)
I got Gunna with me, rockin' VLONE, Supreme (Yeah, yeah)

Stayed the same and they changed up
I knew they was gon' change up
Money never gon' change us

I parked the Bentley inside the garage

I can get you knocked off with a nod
4 Pockets Full, everyone got a knot
I say this shit from the heart
I knew you weren't real, you weren't there from the start
Anything good in my way came from God
Go get on stage and I get an applause

Rich rollin', I'm a star, don't take shots from the bar
But I'm ballin' like Lavar
I put drip all in my lingo, I went crazy
Louis Supreme jean jacket for my baby
My kid a walking lick, I put VVS on his neck
Fucked my sidepiece, some new breasts
Fresh off of high speed in that 'Vette
I can't stop, can't miss this shit, you know I'm never late
Bought a penthouse at the top so I can meditate
On top now 'cause I'm up I gotta elevate
Worth a million five for real, so I accept the hate

Ain't got no regrets, I can't complain my life is great (I'm straight)

Main reason why I'm fuckin' ya bitch, I ain't gon' say shit

I asked you about it, you lied
You asked me about it, I kept it one hundred, I'm nothin' like these other guys
I really spent two thousand on kicks and only wear 'em one time
Something about a nigga mind frame
Diamonds doing jumpin'-jacks in the AP, I can make the time change
Two hundred hoes in my call log and I ain't got not a name saved
Took her out the hood, put her on the drip, now I got her rockin' name brand

Walk down on them broad daylight, it ain't no fun in no drive-by
I'm cool on the love and the high-fives
You niggas can't keep up with my guys
You can't get all this drip in a lifetime
I got out and ran it up at the right time
We got Dracos whenever it's nighttime
We ain't ever gonna stop at the stop sign
Went to Wafi, I told 'em I want to shine
Then the coupe quarter million, they wiped me down
I'm running this town, everything I say facts niggas can't take that
New Lamborghini 18'
Only thing I do is make cream, I don't why these niggas hating
Only thing I do is drink lean, rest in peace to Fredo Santana

Diggin in I got her legs lockin
Super trendy got Chanel stockings
I ain't never had to fantasize it

Swear the ring, the chain, watch, Avianne
I got shooters in the trunk right behind me
I got spots like a cheetah won't find me
Gunna Gunna fell in love with these diamonds
Pressure god only rocking the finest
I done told you the crew is almighty
Several time I just gotta remind you
If you my dog I gotta ride with you
I got you dog on whatever the issue
Free my dogs out of prison I miss you
Fuck the laws and whoever against you
Know the plug I don't go through the middle
Showing love it could all be so simple
I'm a giant remember I used to be little
Getting paid, I don't need no credentials

I’m getting paid
Cartier glasses they sit on my face
I ain’t throwin' shade
I’m getting money, I ain’t in the way
I stay out the way
Free all my dogs till they get out the cage
I’m having my way
Running through hundreds and millions a day
They know not to play
Yeah I’m the one you can see on my face
A mil in my safe
Everywhere I go I’m keepin' a K
I’m getting paid
Cartier glasses they sit on my face
I ain’t throwin' shade

F&N make them back off me
Percocet got me moonwalking
Young nigga tryna stay focused
Niggas play we gon' lay 'em down
Hit his block gon' spray them rounds
Wyclef, it's a man down
Pour the lean, wash the Xans down
In the loft breaking down pounds
First night she from out of town
Blood diamonds straight out the ground
So many hundreds I done lost count"
